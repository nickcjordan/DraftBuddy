Outside of saying, "running backs don't repeat as the top option," there's nothing that should suggest McCaffrey won't. He's not just a running back. He's a wide receiver. He scored 182.5 half-PPR points through the air alone, which would've been the No. 20 wide receiver in fantasy last year, ahead of Stefon Diggs. Even if McCaffrey simply stopped playing football in Week 12, he would've finished as the No. 1 running back by a massive 22.1 PPR points. The new offense and improved quarterback play shouldn't hurt at all.                                                </div>

Playing through injury was a clear net-negative to his overall numbers, and something he hopefully learned from. The biggest difference was breakaway runs of 15-plus yards, as Barkley rattled off 20 of them in his rookie season, but just nine of them in his sophomore season. With all the weapons in this offense, you have to wonder just how many targets Barkley will get, but trust me, the Giants are building their offense around him and not anyone else. If Daniel Jones can take a step forward in year two, it'll help open lanes for Barkley. It also doesn't hurt that they dramatically improved the offensive line this offseason.                                                </div>

Oddly enough, he's never finished as No. 1 though. The Cowboys passing offense just got better with the addition of CeeDee Lamb, and while that may put a cap on Elliott's targets in the passing game, he should be free to rock against seven-man fronts. He saw eight-plus defenders in the box 19.3 percent of the time last year, a number that may dip down into the single digits, provided the Cowboys go three-wide more often than not. Stop trying to find "the next big thing," because Elliott has proven time and time again that he's among the safest picks at the top of the draft. He's posted RB2 or better numbers in 92.9 percent of his career games, which is better than any running back I've ever charted. In fact, the closest is Le'Veon Bell, who's hit that mark 87.0 percent of the time.                                                </div>

His 2019 season was easily his worst to date, though he still finished as the RB12 despite missing two games. The Saints offense continues to groove, and though Drew Brees is still playing great football, his arm strength is declining, which could lead to more targets than every for Kamara, who's averaged 6.7 targets per game over the first three years in a Saints uniform. Provided he doesn't get hurt, Kamara is a near-lock to finish as a top-six running back.                                                </div>

With Stefon Diggs gone, we could see him highlighted even more in the passing game, though Justin Jefferson will eat some of them. Cook also led the league with 21 carries inside the five-yard-line. Health has always been a question mark with Cook, but when healthy, he's easily a top-10 back.                                                </div>

Should we automatically assume Henry picks up where he left off in 2019? My issue with Henry is that he's not involved in the passing-game, which lowers his weekly floor. That alone will allow us to choose someone like Alvin Kamara over him. Henry is best-suited as a second-round pick rather than one in the first round.                                                </div>

It's another thing to project a breakout due to an increase in offensive production. Mixon got the opportunity last year under Zac Taylor, as he totaled 18-plus touches on 10 different occasions. But he'll need the offense to take a step forward in 2020 if he wants to ascend into stardom, as he's been an RB2 or better in just 57 percent of his games over the last two years. You must pay attention to his contract status as you approach drafts because Mixon has stated he'll hold out without an extension. This is a real thing with running backs, as they're trying to preserve their health while cashing in on a second contract. Stay tuned.                                                </div>

Insert Tom Brady into the offense, and you suddenly have room for optimism that it continues. The arrival of Rob Gronkowski hurts a bit, but knowing Bruce Arians has used Godwin the way he used Larry Fitzgerald, the numbers should continue to grow. Godwin is a legitimate WR1 in fantasy once again in 2020.                                                </div>

They waited until the fourth round to select UCLA's Joshua Kelley, who's a bigger complementary back. The Chargers offense isn't likely going to be as high scoring as it was with Philip Rivers under center, but Ekeler remains the top dog in the backfield. Still, don't just anticipate this offense is going to be as potent, or that he'll have as many scoring opportunities, which is why he's best-suited as a high-end RB2 than an RB1.                                                </div>

He's as safe as they come and should still be in the prime of his career at 30 years old. Patrick Mahomes took a step back in terms of touchdown percentage in 2019, but could very well bounce back to elite levels in 2020, giving Kelce consideration as a second-round pick in fantasy drafts. If you have "your guys" in the middle rounds, Kelce makes sense as an early-round pick. He's now posted TE1-type numbers in 28-of-32 games over the last two years. It also helps when you see 41.4 percent of your team's targets inside the 10-yard line, like Kelce did in 2019.                                                </div>

The 49ers added Brandon Aiyuk who'll help stretch the field, which should in turn just open things a bit more for Kittle. His arrow continues to point up. The touchdowns may not match those of Travis Kelce, but we know not to rely on consistency in that department.                                                </div>

It's not looking likely that Jacobs sees the 50-plus targets he deserves, which lowers him down the rankings.

They didn't fix the offensive line, which means running the ball will be difficult again. They also didn't replace Taylor Gabriel's 5.6 targets per game that he was receiving under Matt Nagy with anyone noteworthy in the draft or free agency. There's a realistic scenario where Robinson sees 150-plus targets this year. If you want to go RB heavy in the first few rounds, Robinson could make for a solid low-end WR1.                                                </div>

Is that worrisome to Jones' production? Maybe a bit, as Matt LaFleur seems to want to continue his timeshare ways. Jones is by far the most talented, so even if we were to see him dip down to 13-15 touches per game, that's enough for him to do damage, especially considering Rodgers targets him in the passing game. Jones is one of just two running backs (Alvin Kamara is the other) who've finished with a top-30 season over the last 10 years with less than 300 touches. Jones is one of the most efficient running backs in football, though the coaching staff keeps him in RB2 territory.                                                </div>

Tom Brady isn't a risk-taker, as evidenced by his low interception totals. With the ascention of Chris Godwin, arrival of Rob Gronkowski and Keshawn Vaughn, and likely declining pass attempts in the Bucs offense, Evans may lose some of his top-end upside, though he should still remain in the low-end WR1 conversation.                                                </div>

The issue is that the Panthers decided to add another target to the offense, snagging Robby Anderson in free agency. It'll make his target share a bit lower, though the defense is in severe rebuild mode, which should allow for more pass attempts. Moore remains a relatively safe WR2 even if his upside took a hit.                                                </div>

If Jackson can stay on the field, he is a virtual lock to finish among the top three fantasy QBs because of his rushing floor. Do know, however, that thinner run-heavy QBs have had trouble staying on the field so there is some risk at grabbing him in the 2nd or 3rd round.                                                </div>

Ertz should still be considered a top-five tight end by everyone, but he's not someone to consider in the top four rounds.                                                </div>

You must remember he posted back-to-back 1,200-plus yard seasons before 2019. Not just that, but with the teams forced to stay away from camps, Kirk Cousins won't have much time to develop chemistry with any of the other receivers, so Thielen should be a target monster. He should have a bounceback season.                                                </div>

He did show that he's still able to handle a big workload down the stretch, finishing with 98 touches over the final five games. Now going to the Falcons, who have one of the better offensive lines in football, with little competition, Gurley could return to RB1 status. It's a high-scoring offense where the running backs have averaged 1,383 yards and 9.7 touchdowns on the ground, while averaging another 572 yards and 4.7 touchdowns through the air over the last three years. With Ito Smith and Brian Hill the only running backs behind him, Gurley should receive most of the work/production.                                                </div>

With Jay Gruden calling the offense, they should be much more efficient this year, though Fournette's volume made him a great play throughout 2019. The only running backs who offered RB2 or better numbers more often than Fournette in 2019 were Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott, Dalvin Cook, and Austin Ekeler. Do they go with more of a timeshare under Gruden? it's possible, but he should still offer low-end RB1 value.                                                </div>

He's a true three-down back who can catch 80-plus passes out of the backfield, while running for 1,000-plus yards. Landing with the Chiefs was a dream scenario, especially in the first round. Over the last seven years, running backs who've been drafted in the first round have averaged 280.7 touches in year one. 75 percent of them have finished as an RB2 or better. Don't think this is Darwin Thompson all over again, as he was a sixth-round pick last year, and those average just 29.8 touches in year one. This is Edwards-Helaire's backfield after Andy Reid said he's better than Brian Westbrook on film. You don't take those players off the field very often. He's worth a second-round pick and would be a steal in the third round.                                                </div>

Now going into his third NFL season, there's a real chance for a breakout, though Julio Jones isn't going away any time soon. If you want to know if there's room for both to be WR1s, look no further than the Bucs last year with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, though it's rare for that to happen. Still, Ridley is an ascending talent and the Falcons didn't add a receiver of significance to replace Mohamed Sanu.                                                </div>

Instead, he joins a now-exciting Broncos offense that suddenly has tons of firepower. You don't add Gordon in free agency if you don't plan on using him as your lead back. The potential upside is that new offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur has been a one-back kind of guy, so it's possible that Phillip Lindsay is just there to give Gordon breathers when he needs them. With Courtland Sutton, Jerry Jeudy, KJ Hamler, and Noah Fant out there are receiving threats, Gordon should see a lot of light fronts this year. He's a middling RB2 with RB1 upside if they decide to give him 15-plus touches per game.                                                </div>

With Tyrod Taylor and/or Justin Herbert under center, the Chargers are not going to be throwing the ball a whole lot. There were nearly 600 targets to go around last year, which could be cut down to around the 500 mark, and that would severely impact Allen's targets. Not just that, but his efficiency is likely to come down with the decline in quarterback play. His talent should help get him into WR2 territory, but I think the days of him being a WR1 are in the rearview mirror.                                                </div>

That's odd for me to say, as Bell was someone I was avoiding like the plague in drafts. The difference? Expectations. Playing him as your first-round pick in your RB1 slot was never something anyone should've expected, especially behind that offensive line and in Gase's offense. While he's still stuck in Gase's offense, the offensive line was upgraded quite a bit this offseason, which should allow Bell more room to work. Even if he repeated his 2019 performance, that's RB2 production. There were just 11 running backs who produced RB2 or better numbers more often than him. Sure, he didn't have a ton of weekly upside, but he was safe. Now coming off the board outside the top three rounds, Bell is a value play.                                                </div>

He did have 10 games with 7-8 targets in 2019, so he's inching closer, though the Ravens are still going to be a run-first team. Because of that, you're going to get some duds from the talented tight end. There were six games in 2019 where he posted single-digit PPR points, which is not great when he'll cost you a top-50 pick in drafts. We know Lamar Jackson's touchdown rate will drop, which means we'll need more targets for Andrews to live up to this draft spot. Losing Hayden Hurst as competition surely helps.                                                </div>

Now, with Jeudy, Hamler, Melvin Gordon, and year two Noah Fant in the mix, Sutton should be considered unlikely to match that number in 2020 and beyond.                                                </div>

That's a lot of work. The only running back they've added was David Johnson. While Johnson looked horrendous down the stretch, it's possible he just tried to work his way back from injury way too soon. It appears Bill O'Brien isn't convinced that Johnson is done with his NFL career, like some. It's possible that he's not as electric as he once was, but guys, the Texans gave Carlos Hyde (who's still unemployed) 255 touches last year. Opportunity is key in fantasy football, and Johnson appears to be in line for a lot of it in 2020, making him a low-end RB2 with upside for more should he actually be healthy.                                                </div>

It wasn't all pretty, as he had four games with less than 40 yards, but they were going through a lot of changes on the offense. They reportedly tried to acquire Amari Cooper, but after failing to land him, they fell back on Antonio Gandy-Golden in the fourth round of the draft. He's not going to threaten McLaurin's lead role on the team. It's safe to say we should expect 100-plus targets in year two, even if they aren't highly efficient coming from Dwayne Haskins.                                                </div>

Not only that, but he also offered a ceiling, hitting 16-plus points on five separate occasions. The issue with relying on that again is the new competition for targets. As much as we don't want to consider Jason Witten a threat, he's going to steal some targets. Not just him, but Henry Ruggs, Lynn Bowden, and Bryan Edwards are all guys who'll demand some sort of target share. I still view Waller as a top-five tight end, though he's teetering there.                                                </div>

He tallied just 94 targets last year, and that's despite Adam Thielen being hurt for half the season. Diggs has seen more than 112 targets just once in his career, a number that should be attainable in Buffalo, though John Brown and Cole Beasley both topped 100 targets last year. To think Diggs can be more than a WR2, they'd have to severely cut Brown's and Beasley's targets to get him there. With Josh Allen's inconsistency throwning the ball down the field, it'd be unwise to trust Diggs as anything more than a low-end WR2 in fantasy.                                                </div>

Despite the fact that Ingram had more than 15 carries just twice all season, he finished as the No. 8 running back. We aren't banking on that happening again, especially when the Ravens drafted JK Dobbins in the second round of the NFL Draft. Ingram is going to be 31 years old this year, while Dobbins and Justice Hill have young, fresh legs. We could see Ingram lose a few carries a game, but provided he's healthy, we should still expect him to lead this timeshare and be a borderline RB2.                                                </div>

His 48.1 percent QB1 hit-rate ranks 10th since 2000, though he refuses to bust, scoring fewer than 14.0 fantasy points in just 27.3 percent of his games, which ranks as the fifth-lowest mark in that time. He's reportedly asked the Seahawks brass to unleash the passing game a bit more in 2020, which could give him a bit more upside.

He's also running behind the best offensive line in football, so it wouldn't be a shock to see him rush for 1,200 yards in year one with his vision and speed in the open field. Taylor is right in the same territory as someone like Nick Chubb.                                                </div>

GM Brandon Beane said, "I think more of the goal line and things like that as we did with Frank last year, you'll see Zack do. I think Devin will do a similar role that he had." This is your reminder that Singletary had just two carries inside the five-yard-line all year, while Josh Allen had five, and Frank Gore had 11. That's a crushing blow to Singletary's value.                                                </div>

It just doesn't feel likely that Landry will see the 138 or 149 targets he did over the last two seasons.

Green will also cap his target share. Still, there is some reason for optimism, as Boyd has now finished with 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, and will get an upgrade at quarterback. He's best viewed as a WR3 with upside to make it into the top 15.                                                </div>

The issue is that they are getting Jerick McKinnon back, still have Tevin Coleman, and Jeff Wilson. The passing game also got a new weapon, which could lead to slightly more pass attempts. Despite being on the roster the past two years under Shanahan, Mostert has received 171 carries in 25 games. It's tough to see that changing drastically. There's a chance, which is why he's in the high-end RB3 conversation, but there's also a chance you can't start him with confidence every week.                                                </div>

From the time he entered the lineup last year, he was the No. 26 running back in half-PPR formats while Nick Chubb was the No. 18 running back. The reason we have to assume he'll have a role is due to the Browns tendering him with a second rounder instead of moving on. Chubb is the superior play in this backfield, but it's important to note that Hunt has standalone value, while also offering league-winning handcuff value. If Chubb were to miss time, Hunt would be a top-five play.                                                </div>

We don't really know just yet, though his 9.2-yard average depth of target shouldn't be impacted by quarterback play too much. Unless you're expecting Mohamed Sanu or N'Keal Harry to hit 100-plus targets, Edelman should be safe to hit the century mark, even if the offense is less potent than in years past. But also don't forget to take his injury history into consideration, as the reward might not be worth the risk anymore without Tom Brady there.                                                </div>

Kerryon Johnson has been solid for the Lions when on the field, though he's had issues staying on the field, and the Lions are tired of bringing in guys like LeGarrette Blount, C.J. Anderson, and Bo Scarbrough. So, they'll likely work both running backs to keep them healthy and fresh. I do believe Swift is the better back, hence the higher ranking, but expecting more than 12-14 touches per game out of the gate would be a mistake.                                                </div>

It's going to be even harder when you're a rookie who was coming off foot surgery and dealing with ankle injuries throughout the year. That was the reality for Brown, who played just 14 games, yet finished as a top-50 fantasy wide receiver. The team added a few wide receivers in the draft ,but no one who should trump him in targets. If the Ravens drop back to pass a bit more in 2020, Brown could be a legitimate breakout option, though he shouldn't be drafted as anything more than an upside WR3/4.                                                </div>

No matter who is under center, they're not going to be throwing the ball a lot. Tyrod Taylor has never attempted more than 436 attempts in a season, and Justin Herbert is a rookie who'll go through growing pains. We already saw Henry being somewhat scaled back in this offense last year, as he failed to top 45 yards in each of the last five games. For a guy who's never topped 652 yards in a season and getting a downgrade at quarterback, he has a high draft price, and is likely not going to live up to expectations.                                                </div>

The addition of Stefon Diggs won't hurt Allen's passing totals, but it's on the ground where he makes most of his marks, and I'm expecting that to regress.                                                </div>

He's seen a massive 290 targets over the last three years, and it's extremely unlikely the Patriots have Jarrett Stidham drop back anywhere close to the number of times Brady did. Not just that, but Brady always targeted his running backs in the passing game. There are just too many questions to rely on him for anything for more than low-end RB3/high-end RB4 production.                                                </div>

And lastly, he was at just 18.8 percent in 2017, the ninth-lowest mark. Meanwhile, he'll give you big games here and there while not completely tanking your team. If you want to wait at wide receiver in your draft and play him as your WR3, it's not that bad.                                                </div>

The issue is that he's posted WR3 or better numbers in just 33.3 percent of his games, which ranks 94th (right behind Donte Moncrief) during that time. The loss of Deandre Hopkins should provide him with a more stable target floor, though Brandin Cooks is arguably a better football player than Fuller and will steal a lot of those targets. The chemistry between Fuller and Deshaun Watson has to be taken into account, but so does the injury history. Ideally, you draft him as a WR4 that you can rely on as a WR3 while healthy.                                                </div>

What we didn't know was that they'd take one with their first pick in the draft. While Darrell Henderson is a threat to Akers' overall workload, they clearly know what they have in Henderson, and drafted Akers early. It seems like Henderson is going to be the lesser part of the timeshare, while Akers is the early-down back and likely to receive goal-line work. There's a chance Henderson has a bigger role than anticipated, which prevents us from trusting Akers as anything more than a high-end RB3.                                                </div>

Cooks. Keep in mind he's done that while playing for three different teams, so he's essentially team-proof. Concussions were problematic in 2019 and will be a problem moving forward in his career, as another one could end it. While on the field, though, he's proven to have a WR2 floor in the NFL. We can't pretend that going to Deshaun Watson isn't an upgrade from Jared Goff, either. The issue is that Will Fuller plays a similar role and has chemistry with Watson. Cooks can likely be drafted as a WR4, but he'll be a starter when he's on the field.                                                </div>

You don't want to write him off completely, but he fits in more as a low-end WR3/high-end WR4 in 2020.                                                </div>

His lack of big plays crushed his hopes in 2019, as he went down to just 6.3 percent. Still, his floor stayed intact, highlighting he's still the same player. There's an in-between 2018 and 2019 outcome that's likely in 2020. He's never going to be a workhorse running back, but he's going to beat his current ADP.                                                </div>

McKissic. So, even if Guice is the lead back, it's unlikely he's a workhorse, and will concede passing-down work to one of Gibson/McKissic. On a low-scoring team, it's hard to find the upside in Guice's projection, even if he does return to perfect health, which has been an issue.                                                </div>

The issue was that he lacked upside, topping 20 PPR points just twice all year. Now adding Stefon Diggs to the offense, his target share is going to dip and make him much more inconsistent, as they're both perimeter players who'll compete for targets. After seeing 115 targets in 2019, it's possible that number dips into the 80-90 range in 2020. This receiving corps will be better for real life football in 2020, but fantasy-wise, there's likely to be a lot of bumpy roads.                                                </div>

He saw just 81 targets and had just two games with more than eight targets. The 49ers offense is going to be run-heavy, but Samuel will be the go-to guy when they do drop back to pass. He's also included in the run-game, as evidenced by his 159 rushing yards and three touchdowns last year. It's tough to see him having a true breakout season, especially when he suffered a broken foot during offseason training. The rumor is that he may not even be ready for Week 1 of the season. When a pass-catcher has foot surgery in the same calendar year, it usually means bad things for fantasy purposes. You may want to wait until 2021 to invest a redraft pick on the young receiver.                                                </div>

Not only did they not draft a wide receiver, but they also traded up and drafted a quarterback in the first round. The way the Packers drafted suggest that they don't realize they have an all-time great as their quarterback. Here's a fun stat: Rodgers has thrown 364 touchdowns in his career. Just one of them has gone to a player drafted in the first round. The Packers aren't going to become a pass-first team under Matt LaFleur, meaning Rodgers won't be a fantasy stud. Still, he's played at least 15 games 10 times in his career, and has never finished worse than the No. 9 quarterback.                                                </div>

Golden Tate is aging, and while Darius Slayton did flash at times, it was a relatively small sample size. It shouldn't shock anyone to see Shepard get 100-plus targets in 2020 and finish as a WR3, though you do have to wonder what his upside actually is with so many mouths to feed.                                                </div>

The Jets moved on from Robby Anderson and brought in Breshad Perriman, who's now with his fourth team in as many years, and drafted rookie Denzel Mims in the second round. While you can assume those players walk in and see targets, it's Crowder who'll likely be Darnold's go-to guy. He may not be a sexy pick, but he'll get the job done for a cheap WR4.                                                </div>

Going to the Saints, he's not going to need a whole lot of targets to produce, but betting on him being anything other than a bye week filler would be a mistake. The Saints offense runs through Michael Thomas, and you're not going to take targets from him to feed a 33-year-old.                                                </div>

But for whatever reason, Matt Nagy has chosen not to let Miller flourish in the Bears offense. There were just seven games he saw more than three targets. In those seven games, he totaled 42 receptions for 547 yards, and two touchdowns. With Taylor Gabriel gone, it's very possible that Miller becomes more of a staple in the offense.

The issue with projecting that moving forward is due to his offensive line play. The Dolphins have what may be the worst line in football, while Howard has only run behind top-10 offensive lines while in Chicago and Philadelphia. Still, if you need a running back who's likely locked into 12-plus touches a week, Howard can fill a role on your fantasy team.                                                </div>

The Patriots spent a first-round pick on him, so he'll be given every opportunity to succeed, but they won't allow him to be inefficient much longer with Damien Harris waiting in the wings.

In fact, the closest tight end, Travis Kelce, has posted those numbers in 31.6 percent of his games. While Gronkowski isn't the young stud he once was, but he should be a consistent presence while on the field with Brady.                                                </div>

That limits the upside of Dobbins, as does Lamar Jackson stealing plenty of goal-line touches.                                                </div>

The only other quarterbacks who can say that are Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson. He hit the "boom" mark in 30.8 percent of his starts in 2019, the third-highest mark in the league. Keep in mind that he did that while not having a single game with Barkley, Engram, Shepard, Tate, and Slayton all healthy. He needs to become more consistent, but he does present tons of upside.                                                </div>

What most don't realize is that he's been pretty efficient throughout the course of his career, though injuries haven't allowed him to stay on the field. His career QB Rating is actually higher than Matthew Stafford. Now firmly entrenched as the starter in Tennessee, will he become a fantasy star? The concern is always going to come to lack of pass attempts. If he'd averaged a decent 7.2 yards per attempt last year, he would not have been a consistent fantasy starter. The Titans are not expected to throw the ball 500 times, which means Tannehill would be relying on super high efficiency or his legs to drive his fantasy production. That's a slippery slope on a week-to-week basis, so consider Tannehill a streamer who's unlikely to repeat.                                                </div>

That's a check in the plus column for him, though there are a lot of mouths to feed in the Panthers offense. D.J. Moore, Curtis Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, and Ian Thomas have all shown ability to produce with targets, while Anderson has been extremely hit-or-miss while asked to be "the guy" in New York. He's best viewed as a bench option with week-to-week upside.                                                </div>

If you are looking for this year's version of Darren Waller, it is difficult to look beyond this supreme athlete moving into a much larger role in one of the NFL's top offenses. You can grab Jonnu late in your drafts and if it doesn't work out, move over to streaming the position.                                                </div>

His weekly performances have been relatively similar every year, despite contrary belief. He's posted top-12-type numbers in 43.8 percent of his games in each of the last two years, while hitting that mark 46.7 percent of the time in 2017. The issue in 2019 was the lack of upside, as he didn't have a single game with more than 25.2 fantasy points. He passed that mark five different times in 2018. Does the loss of Todd Gurley as a safety valve hurt his overall potential? Losing Brandin Cooks surely can't help, either. Goff is one of those quarterbacks you can take in the later rounds and hope he gets some of that upside back, because otherwise, he's just a boring streamer.                                                </div>

I'm not willing to say that Henderson is completely out of contention, but his value took a blow in the draft.

This will be his sixth season in the NFL and he's never topped 104 carries in a season despite the fact that he's averaged 4.5 yards per carry (4.91 over the last four years) over his career. Now having to deal with David Johnson, whose best attribute is catching passes out of the backfield, it's unlikely Duke has any value with David healthy. However, it needs to be stated that David has played just 22 full games over the last three years and will be 29 years old at the end of the season. Should he miss time, Duke might get the opportunity that we've been waiting for.                                                </div>

Do you know how many quarterbacks have rushed for more than 500 yards after turning 31? Three. Now as how many of those quarterbacks had more than four rushing touchdowns... None. Newton was once a dominating force who required coordinators to adjust gameplans, but I just don't think he's that guy anymore.                                                </div>

At this point in Watkins' career, you don't have to invest much to buy the lottery ticket.                                                </div>

Not only that, but the Jets are still under Adam Gase, which means there won't be many plays per game. The Jets have what I deemed the toughest schedule in the league for wide receivers, so even if we see Perriman get the targets, he's unlikely to be efficient with them. He closed the 2019 season with 25 receptions for 506 yards and five touchdowns over his last five games, which will have some intrigued, but my guess is that you'll drop Perriman for a hot waiver wire pickup.                                                </div>

He's one of those players who can certainly take the leap into the top-30 receivers if he gets the opportunity, which is rare to find in the late rounds.                                                </div>

He's an ideal bench stash that you can play when we know Jeffery will deal with a top-tier cornerback, or if/when one of them misses a game.

Back in 2014-2015, Rivers threw for 9,078 yards, 60 touchdowns, and 31 interceptions over those two seasons. The offensive line in Indianapolis is the best Rivers has ever played behind, and his receiver corps of T.Y. Hilton, Parris Campbell, and Michael Pittman isn't too shabby, either. He may be towards the end of his career, but he's going to have plenty of fantasy-worthy performances for streamers.                                                </div>

But he should be a prime target in leagues that award bonus points to tight ends, as the youngster showed in 2018 that he can be successful. Frequently targeted downfield, Herndon was one of the league leaders in air yards in 2018, and he could be one of Sam Darnold's primary targets, particularly if the truncated offseason prevents Darnold from developing chemistry with Breshad Perriman and Denzel Mims. He's not a TE1 at this point, but fantasy owners should keep their eyes on him in the preseason.                                                </div>

The issue with expecting that to continue? The Raiders have added tons of pass catchers this offseason, including No. 12 overall pick Henry Ruggs. It's very possible that Renfrow turns into a receiver like Cole Beasley was during his time in Dallas. He's going to have a game here and there, but ultimately, his role isn't big enough to warrant a fantasy starter.                                                </div>

Jay Gruden is his new offensive coordinator, and if you recall, we watched Jamison Crowder flourish under him. Westbrook won't be a league-winner, but it's possible he's a steady WR3/4 option you can plug in for certain matchups. This team will be throwing the ball quite a bit.                                                </div>

Hilton and Pittman will play in 2WR sets, with Parris Campbell coming on when they go three wide. Because of that, Pittman could see a consistent five-plus targets per game.

But them drafting A.J. Dillon in the second round screams "he's the guy" behind Jones, and potentially the one even stealing some goal-line work from Jones. Because of that, Williams is not someone you need to draft in shallow leagues. It's best to see how this backfield shakes out before commiting a bench spot on a handcuff.                                                </div>

He had tremendous numbers when on the field in his earlier years, just like Jackson, who's averaged 5.14 yards per carry over his career to this point. Jackson is going to be fighting for playing time with fourth-round rookie Joshua Kelley this year trying to earn that Melvin Gordon role. It seems likely that the Chargers want Kelley in that role, but is Jackson good enough for them to change their course? It's a situation to monitor, as this will be a run-heavy team.                                                </div>

Moore, Robby Anderson, Curtis Samuel, Ian Thomas, and Christian McCaffrey at his disposal. He could be the 2020 version of Jameis Winston. Why? Because his defense is going through a major rebuilding process and will be allowing tons of points, forcing the Panthers to throw more than they'd like to. He's going to be a favorite of streamers. He's going to be a great option for those in 2QB leagues.                                                </div>

It feels that way with Davis, who is going into the final year of his rookie deal. Unfortunately, he's not on a team that's going to throw the ball 600-plus times like Parker's team did last year. Still, there's an opportunity for increased efficiency with Ryan Tannehill under center and A.J. Brown drawing the opponent's top cornerback. We have watched Davis' yards per target increase each year (5.8, 8.0, 8.7), so you shouldn't abandon all hope. He's someone to stash at the end of your bench.                                                </div>

Although the two tight ends essentially split targets last year, Smith was used fairly closer to the line of scrimmage and almost never had a chance to break big plays. He may see a bit more usage now with plenty of vacated targets in the absence of Stefon Diggs, but he's nothing better than a low-end TE2.                                                </div>

He quietly led the Steelers receivers in yards (735) last year despite trailing Diontae Johnson by 12 targets. His 9.2 yards per target was also much higher than JuJu Smith-Schuster's 7.8 yards per target. The issue is that the Steelers drafted another perimeter option in Chase Claypool, and it seems unlikely that they send Johnson back to the bench. Washington will be battling with Claypool for the No. 3 job in the offense, which will have streaming appeal.                                                </div>

Because of that, Mims should see 70-plus targets in year one with growth for more, and he likely walks in as the best contested catch receiver on the team, meaning he could be a favorite in the red zone.                                                </div>

Seattle isn't a bad place for tight ends, but with Will Dissly expected back and Jacob Hollister still on the roster, it's unlikely that Olsen will see his usual number of targets. He's worth drafting in leagues that give bonus points to tight ends but he's outside the TE1 range in standard-sized leagues.                                                </div>

I don't know if he does either, but when a team spends a second-round pick on a running back, they typically have a plan for them. Over the last seven years, running backs drafted in the second round average 172.3 touches in their rookie season. Dillon is just an early-down back, so he'll be extremely touchdown dependent. Knowing how good Jones has been in that role, it's tough to take him off the field, so I'm fine with going the wait-and-see approach with Dillon (and every other non-Jones back in this backfield).                                                </div>

He's someone you snag during bye weeks to give you a 8-point floor in PPR formats.                                                </div>

The reason I'm not big on Cobb is due to the fact that Deshaun Watson hasn't checked down very much throughout his career.                                                </div>

Howard has the skill to be an impact tight end, but absent an injury to Gronkowski, there's just no path for him this year. Hold onto him in dynasty formats, but ignore him for redraft purposes.                                                </div>

He may not be built like a workhorse back, but he's electric in a run-heavy offense. The Titans would be wise to give him 5-10 touches even when Henry is healthy, though there's no guarantee that will be the case.                                                </div>

They also said they believe Benny Snell can be that guy if something were to happen to Conner. That doesn't mean McFarland will be chopped liver, but it does mean he's not going to be a 10-plus touch running back without injury. I've compared McFarland to Chris Thompson, which would make sense based on the Steelers' comments on the power running backs. If he gets 6-10 touches per week, he has enough explosion on a per-play basis to make an impact at times, but nothing you want to rely on consistently.                                                </div>

Given that he's never had more than 63 catches or 931 yards receiving, it's unlikely that he'll be worth rostering this season.                                                </div>

When you draft a running back in the third round, you typically use him in some sort of role.

He's the clear-cut handcuff to Sony Michel who's been extremely inefficient. If that continues in 2020, we could see the Patriots activate Harris (who doesn't contribute on special teams) and use him as their early-down back.                                                </div>

As of now, Philly is the #13 D/ST in ECR which puts them right on the fence. Frankly, though, there are only three defenses I'd draft over them (PIT, SF and NE in that order). It isn't as though the Eagles have a world-beating defense this year but rather, their Week 1 (and 2 vs LAR) matchups are so good that they'll return more value than other D/ST1s who are fringe-startable in Week 1. The position is so volatile that you can't waste draft capital on a fantasy asset that is historically more likely to finish outside the top 12 D/STs than within the top 5. Take the Eagles against Dwayne Haskins (then Jared Goff), celebrate double-digit fantasy points and move onto the next one-hit-wonder in Week 3.                                                </div>

If Chris Carson struggles coming off his hip injury, or fumbles again, we could see Hyde in a 15-touch role.

He should similarly be among the leaders in attempts this year with Tom Brady at the helm, and if he can improve on his accuracy, he has a legitimate chance to finish as the top fantasy kicker.                                                </div>

Knowing they invested a fourth-round pick on Kelley, it seems likely that he'll get the first crack at the job. Realistically, it could be a three-headed backfield between them. This won't be the same offense it was with Philip Rivers and we're likely to lose some overall potential from a fantasy perspective. But for now, we should assume that Kelley is the handcuff to Ekeler, even though they're completely different players.                                                </div>

Did everyone forget that he was the WR21 in 2017 despite playing with the often-inaccurate Cam Newton? He's now going to play with Aaron Rodgers, one of the most accurate quarterbacks of this era. Funchess has caught a touchdown every 15 targets over the course of his career, which is well above average. He could be the guy who emerges as the No. 2 receiver for Rodgers. He's a great pick in the late rounds as someone you'll learn what you have immediately.                                                </div>

There's a chance he's being underdrafted, but there's also a chance that he remains the No. 4 receiver on the team.                                                </div>

Shenault did have offseason core muscle surgery, so it's possible Conley can hold him to start the year, but that's far from a guarantee.                                                </div>

Now in what was a stagnant offense last year and with several other tight ends on the roster, it would be surprising if Graham found a way to factor in significantly. Ignore him in all leagues but deeper formats that award bonus points to tight ends.                                                </div>

Because they ran the ball at such an historic rate last year, the Ravens' natural regression suggests there should be more targets to go around. Boykin should benefit, but with the addition of Devin Duvernay, there's one more mouth to feed in Baltimore. Boykin should improve, but he's unlikely to see enough work to be worth drafting in fantasy leagues.                                                </div>

The issue with expecting that to continue? There's a new coaching staff and they used a couple high draft picks on receivers, including Antonio Gibson, who is likely to steal a lot of those intermediate routes over the middle of the field. Sims can clearly play in the league, but opportunity is the most important trait.                                                </div>

But, at this point, Myers is just one of a handful of low-end kickers you can consider drafting in a 15-team league.                                                </div>

That's going to limit his fantasy appeal for a team that wants to run the ball fairly often. Still, he's electric with the ball in his hands and is going to have a few weeks that'll make you wish you had him in your starting lineup.                                                </div>

He played running back throughout college but switched to wide receiver his final season, so he can play that movable chess piece in Kyle Shanahan's offense. It's clear the 49ers liked him during the draft process, enough to draft him at the top of the third round.

What's even worse is that his role diminished once Ryan Tannehill was under center. Knowing this is a run-heavy team and one that doesn't consistently have three wide receivers on the field, Humphries should not be considered a fantasy option.                                                </div>

Although a third-year breakout was there to be had with Philip Rivers at quarterback, the Colts' drafting of Michael Pittman Jr. put a major damper on those prospects. Pascal will likely need an injury to get on the fantasy radar this year, so he's more of someone who fantasy managers should look at on the waiver wire rather than during their drafts.                                                </div>

He's been with the 49ers for two years but hasn't played a down of regular season football. Now that they've traded away Matt Breida, there's a role to be had, but we don't know if he's capable at this stage of his career. There's been some whispers that he may not make the team, though that may be a surprise considering they've held onto him this long. Between Raheem Mostert, Tevin Coleman, and McKinnon, it's going to be tough to find consistent volume and production in this backfield.                                                </div>

While Dorsett doesn't have much appeal as the No. 3 wide receiver in a low-volume offense, he does have some rare handcuff value. If Tyler Lockett were forced to miss any time, Dorsett would be the natural replacement in the slot, a role that he exceled in during his time with the Patriots. In fact, Dorsett has averaged 1.46 more fantasy points PER TARGET while in the slot over the last two years, which is more than any other receiver in the league. Something to think about should Lockett miss time.                                                </div>

Now with the Jets, he finds himself in a far less explosive offense, and isn't worth considering unless he can find his accuracy once again.                                                </div>

Even if Trubisky begins the year as the starter, he almost certainly won't have much fantasy value, and should be an afterthought on draft day.                                                </div>

The question is whether the Ravens will move him above Willie Snead right away, as that's the role he needs to work his way into (the slot). Duvernay has much more playmaking ability than Snead, but knowing there's been limited offseason work, it's unlikely we see many rookies get the nod.                                                </div>

The last time Gore played for Gase (in 2018), he tallied 722 yards on the ground but failed to score a single touchdown.

The Raiders clearly have better receivers on their roster heading into this season, and while they did allow DeAndre Washington and his 40 targets walk, it's tough to find very much work available to Bowden. He's a name to watch, though, as you don't spend a second-round pick on a player you don't have plans for. Keep him on waiver wire speed dial.                                                </div>

Probably not right away, but he should surpass him as the year goes on. Unfortunately, it's hard to see a scenario where the Raiders have two consistent wide receivers in fantasy.                                                </div>

Although he led the NFL in passing yards with 5,109, he also threw 30 interceptions and completed barely 60% of his passes. Now a backup to Drew Brees, Winston could become extremely interesting with an injury, though the presence of Taysom Hill might negate that potential. There's zero reason to draft Winston in redraft leagues, but his value in dynasty formats would obviously get an enormous boost if he takes over after Brees inevitably retires next season.                                                </div>

Willams played just 11 games last season, splitting time with a number of Chiefs RBs, but he was the primary ball carrier the majority of the games he played. He rushed for 104 yards and a score in the Super Bowl, and for that the Chiefs may have to give him opportunities early on this season. Williams is only under contract for one more season, and Kansas City went ahead and drafted his eventual replacement in Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the first round. It\u2019ll be interesting to see the split between the two backs, but figure they\u2019ll both play a role early on in the season.

","note":"Diggs is the newest member to join Allen\u2019s arsenal of weapons on offense. He\u2019s been dubbed one of the best route runners in the league by many and should get lots of opportunities to show that in Buffalo.
