He finished as an RB1 in 75 percent of his games, while hitting at least RB2 numbers in 93.8 percent of his games. Some are excited about his target possibilities with Odell Beckham Jr. gone, but it's likely going to bring more attention to him and the run-game. Still, Barkley showed last year that he's able to overcome a lot, making him a relatively safe top-three selection in every format, but the lack of scoring from this offense can really hold him back.                                                </div>

It's fair and you shouldn't shy away from the three-down back, but you should know that the Panthers have openly talked about scaling back his workload. He's still likely to finish as a top-five option at the position even if he loses 4-6 touches per game, as he's gamescript-proof and it's not as if Cam Newton is rushing for as many touchdowns as he used to.                                                </div>

He's likely going to walk into the old Ingram role, though it's important to note that it's no guarantee he's able to fit in this offense. You remember Adrian Peterson with the Saints, right? He was able to go to the Redskins and get it done, so maybe Sean Payton's offense just isn't right for everyone. Because of that, Kamara gets a slight bump in upside, which was already high to begin with, as he has finished as the RB3 and RB4 in his first two seasons with Ingram on the roster.                                                </div>

If he can jump another 40 points, we'd be looking at the WR1 if he qualified for that possession.

Anderson play over him during the playoffs, but the Rams also traded up to the start of the third-round to select Darrell Henderson, an explosive running back out of Memphis. The Rams also matched an offer sheet the Lions submitted to backup running back Malcolm Brown, meaning the Rams are more worried about Gurley than they're letting on. We all know Gurley comes with plenty of upside, but we also know you can't win your fantasy league in the first-round, but you can definitely help lose it.                                                </div>

His minor concerns over the frostbite and threatened retirement drop his stock a bit, but he is still a WR1.                                                </div>

He's still a force to be reckoned with and one of the three tight ends worth a pick in the first three rounds                                                </div>

Probably not, because it had him falling outside the top 35 running backs selected the following year. In that season, he totaled just 248 yards and one touchdown on 65 carries. That's significant because that's the only year he played under Dirk Koetter, who is now back in Atlanta as the coordinator. While Freeman will have a much bigger role, Koetter hasn't been able to boost a run-game during his time in Atlanta or Tampa Bay, so the ceiling has likely dropped for Freeman. And that's not to mention Ito Smith, whose role grew as the year went on in 2018                                                </div>

With Mike Evans stealing quite a large share of the targets, you have to wonder just how high the ceiling is for Godwin, as the Bucs are likely going to run the ball a bit more under Arians. Godwin is a rock-solid player, but you mustn't forget that he's the No. 2 receiver on his team, and there's also a tight end (O.J. Howard) who deserves a lot of targets by his own right. It's okay to like Godwin in 2019, but keep expectations in check                                                </div>

It's a good thing that they'll be a run-first team with Lamar Jackson under center, but it's also a bad thing around the goal-line, as Jackson is more of a threat to score than Ingram. The Ravens drafted Justice Hill, and still have Kenneth Dixon and Gus Edwards on the roster, so it may be more of a timeshare than some believe, though Ingram should be the leader in the clubhouse. His lack of upside drops him below some of the other options in his range                                                </div>

So, what does that say about Montgomery, who they traded up into the third-round to get? Howard finished as the RB20 in his first season under Matt Nagy. Montgomery was likely the best pure runner in the draft who's already shown the ability to handle a workhorse role, and offers more in the passing-game than Howard did, though most of that work will go to Tarik Cohen. Montgomery was drafted on a team that's built to win right now, which means he'll have big value immediately                                                </div>

Moore is the superior player, but he'll also see more top-tier cornerbacks than Samuel will.

While some would expect him to build on that, the Falcons aren't likely to throw the ball as much as they did in 2018 due to their defensive stars being healthy again.

That track record is rather impossible to beat, even if Patrick Mahomes is coming off the best fantasy season of all-time. Don't reach for a quarterback with all the options available this year, but if Rodgers were to fall to the late-fourth or early-fifth-round, you should absolutely pull the trigger                                                </div>

Think of Cohen as a younger James White who may not see as many targets, but will get more carries                                                </div>

It's rare to find a wide receiver being drafted outside the top-25 wide receivers with top-10 upside, but Williams has it                                                </div>

If you pro-rate his 2018 numbers out to a full season, we were looking at a pace of 90 receptions, 1,374 yards and 12 scores. Friends, that would have placed him sixth among wide receivers in fantasy scoring, just between Julio Jones and Michael Thomas.                                                </div>

Instead, many are wondering whether he'll be able to deliver top-30 numbers now that they drafted A.J. Brown and spent some serious money on Adam Humphries. It was tough for Marcus Mariota to support a consistent wide receiver with the talent they had and it's unlikely that this makes it easier on the talented Davis who was a WR3 or better in just 37.5 percent of his games last year                                                </div>

Last year, he accomplished it despite having a terrible receiving corps, which has since seen significant upgrades., It isn't a stretch to put his ceiling at 5,000 yards and 45 touchdowns this year, which would obviously make him the top fantasy QB. With that said, the potential to re-injure to the shoulder also gives him a low floor. The problem here, is that the Colts have not been forthcoming about injuries and this calf/ankle/bone issue continues to get worse so he could very well miss a month or more.                                                </div>

The addition of Keke Coutee is going to eat into his target share, but Fuller was always somewhat of a big-play threat who needed to get it done on limited targets.

When playing on the perimeter, Shepard has seen 62 targets over the last two years and hasn't scored a touchdown. If you're drafting him, it's due to his increase in volume, because his efficiency will take a hit. You also need to know that he suffered a broken thumb during the first few days of training camp and is unlikely to play at all in the preseason. They're expecting him to be ready for Week 1, but it's something to monitor.                                                </div>

Over the last two years, Kamara has totaled at least 100 targets, which tells you that Cook's ceiling is extremely limited                                                </div>

Not much slides past me, but did you know McDonald saw 73 targets in 2018? That ranked 12th among tight ends and he finished as the No. 10 fantasy tight end. If McDonald stays on the field, he's absolutely locked-in for 90-plus targets and a top-eight finish in 2019                                                </div>

Doug Pederson has allowed one running back to play more than 42 snaps in a game during his three years in Philadelphia: Darren Sproles, a do-it-all running back. Howard topped that number five times while with the Bears in 2018 alone with absolutely zero competition for the early-down role.

He finished with just over 700 yards, which isn't horrible, but he now has a quarterback (Joe Flacco) who hasn't supported consistency out of wide receivers his entire career. On top of that, the Broncos moved to a defense-first head coach who'll want to run the ball a bit more often. It's tough to see Sutton overcoming some of these obstacles and breaking out in 2019                                                </div>

Those who say that will point to last year's finish, but Goff struggled prior to Gurley leaving the lineup, as he was in some sort of funk after their bye week (likely due to Cooper Kupp missing). Still, under Sean McVay, Goff has been a top-12 type performer in 14-of-31 games (45.2 percent), which may not sound like much, but it would rank 11th among quarterbacks the last two years. He's a low-end QB1/high-end QB2 who might see an increase in pass attempts this year                                                </div>

Now, his totals were inflated due to more passing than the Falcons wanted to do last year, as their defense was in shambles, forcing them to air it out against opponents. Hooper saw what was a career-high 88 targets because of that. With Calvin Ridley entering his second year, he figures to be more involved as well. Despite his top-six finish, Hooper posted top-12 type numbers just 37.5 percent of the time, which was tied with Jimmy Graham, and Trey Burton for 13th among tight ends, so there were some big performances to help him get there, and not so much consistency                                                </div>

Plus, Coutee actually had more targets than even Hopkins when the two shared the field together.                                                </div>

He tallied 85 carries and 81 targets last year, which is more than enough volume in that high-scoring offense to be fantasy relevant. The Colts have said they want Marlon Mack to carry most of the workload, but think of Hines like the Duke Johnson of their offense. He should offer RB4 numbers regularly in PPR formats, though he doesn't offer much upside, even if Mack were to miss time, as they'd share the workload between him, Spencer Ware, and Jordan Wilkins                                                </div>

He'll be the starter as long as he's healthy and with Kliff Kingsbury wanting to run 70-plus plays per game, it'll create plenty of fantasy points. The disparity in fantasy points per dropback isn't that large, so the more often he does it, the better, especially knowing he can rush for 500-plus yards. If Murray can stay on the field for all 16 games, he should be locked-in as a top-12 quarterback                                                </div>

That's going to provide a fantasy floor that you cannot find late in drafts. If you miss out on one of the high-tier quarterbacks you were aiming for, Jackson can help provide a stable floor while your stud running backs and wide receivers take care of the rest (because you took them instead of a quarterback in the higher rounds). From Week 11 forward, Jackson was the QB8 in fantasy, right in between Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson. If he develops more as a passer, his ceiling only gets higher                                                </div>

Rivers is a very consistent quarterback, but he's not going to help lead your team to a championship. There was just one game in 2018 where he totaled more than 24 fantasy points, and it's because his defense has continually gotten better. He also doesn't offer anything rushing, so unless his defense takes a step back in 2019, he's not going to have much of a chance to deliver much better numbers in 2019                                                </div>

Remember when Quincy Enunwa played in the slot prior to Jermaine Kearse returning to the lineup? Enunwa totaled 37 targets over the first four weeks. Then Kearse took over and proceeded to get 48 targets over the next six weeks. The point is that Sam Darnold does like his slot receiver and the Jets signed Crowder very early in free agency, highlighting the need. He's just not a sexy pick, which is why the consensus is lower on him                                                </div>

Samuels was never meant to be a 20-plus touch back, but he's likely going to be involved much more, even when James Conner is healthy. The issue is that Snell is a threat to his upside and would likely be the primary back if Conner were to go down with an injury. Because of that, Samuels may be locked into a Chris Thompson/Giovani Bernard type role, which doesn't do much for your fantasy team. Unless we hear he's the primary backup, he's not someone you should roster                                                </div>

On top of that, Joe Flacco has never really supported a consistent wide receiver in fantasy for more than spurts.

While he did finish as the No. 7 tight end, anyone who owned him can tell you it was frustrating. He played all 16 games, but he was hampered by some injuries at the end of the year. While year two could bring more consistency, we should have both Anthony Miller and Allen Robinson nearing full health, as they dealt with injuries as well in 2018. Burton isn't going to turn into Travis Kelce despite playing in the same offense, but he's still likely going to finish as a top-10 tight end at year's end                                                </div>

Between them two, they posted 198.5 fantasy points over the 13 games that Garoppolo didn't play. Over the course of a full season, that would have amounted to the No. 16 quarterback. That was with Marquise Goodwin missing in action much of the time, with Pierre Garcon out for the year, and with Dante Pettis not getting on the field in a full-time role until the end of the season. Not only will Pettis be a full-time receiver, but the 49ers also drafted Deebo Samuel and Jalen Hurd inside the top three rounds. The running backs on the roster are all better pass-catchers than they are ball-carriers, which again favors Garoppolo                                                </div>

It doesn't matter if he's there in the 13th round, let someone else take on that burden. Not only is he suspended for the first eight games of the season, but he's behind a guy who rushed for nearly 1,000 yards despite not starting until Week 7. Did I mention that running back was also drafted by the Browns at the start of the second-round in 2018? The first four weeks of the season are the most important weeks of the season for the waiver wire, so why hold yourself hostage with a guy who's not even a lock to play once his suspension is over? Not to mention bye week issues you'll have. On top of that, you've never seen him outside a Chiefs offense, where every running back put in the lineup succeeds. I'm not saying he's not a good player, but Chubb is better                                                </div>

Anderson carry the Rams offense at the end of last season, he settled for a one-year deal with the Lions to play alongside the up-and-coming Kerryon Johnson.

If you combined Blount and Zach Zenner's roles from last year, they netted 209 carries, 683 yards, and eight touchdowns on the ground. Anderson is going to clog upside on your bench as long as Johnson is in the lineup. If Johnson were to miss time, Anderson would likely be considered a low-end RB2                                                </div>

In fact, he's turned in WR3 or better performances in 44.7 percent of his games, which is better than the career rates of Emmanuel Sanders, Robert Woods, and Kenny Golladay. A new coaching staff will likely do him some good as it appeared he and Adam Gase never truly saw eye-to-eye. The quarterback position has improved, and from the reports of local beat reporters, Parker has dominated mini-camp.

The bad news is that he's no longer the No. 1 target in the offense and he's continually losing targets to Christian McCaffrey, who set the record for receptions by a running back in 2018. Through 16 games the last two seasons, Olsen has seen a combined 76 targets, totaling 482 yards and five touchdowns. He has played through some injuries, so that's not exactly precise, but it's not far off from what you'll get out of him moving forward                                                </div>

It's why he was being drafted as a top-36 wide receiver last year. A year later, everyone has forgotten about him. The 49ers have drafted three wide receivers inside the top three rounds over the last two years, but as we saw with Dante Pettis last year, it doesn't mean they'll get on the field right away. Goodwin still possesses game-changing speed down the field, but is likely going to lose snaps as the year goes on                                                </div>

He's performed at a top-12 level in just 29.5 percent of his 78 career games, which is worse than the career of DeShone Kizer and Blake Bortles. Even if he steps up his passing, his lack of rushing totals severely caps his upside. He's not a bad option in 2QB leagues for those who wait, as he has no chance of being benched, but stay away in standard leagues                                                </div>

That was Evan Engram who needed injuries to Odell Beckham, Brandon Marshall, and Sterling Shepard to get there. If Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay were to go down with injuries, then it's okay to rely on the rookie Hockenson                                                </div>

Unless they bench their leading receiver last year (Zay Jones), Foster won't be on the field very much. It's possible he overtakes Jones, but do you really want the third option on a run-first team.

No. The offense has been completely overhauled, starting up top with the head coach Adam Gase, who turned Mike Gesicki into an afterthought in fantasy, though many experts had him as the top tight end in last year's class. The Jets also added Jamison Crowder and Le'Veon Bell, two players who'll take targets away from Herndon over the middle of the field. Gase's offense has produced less than 58 plays in two of his last three seasons and the Jets are likely to play solid defense with a ball-control style offense.

After signing a four-year, $88 million contract, he's entrenched as the starter, which means something to those playing in 2QB formats. Outside of his bye week (and potential injury), Foles can be in your lineup. Understand that his upside is nearly non-existent without a true No. 1 receiver or tight end, and on a team who is going to be run-heavy. He'll likely finish as a top-24 quarterback due to his job security, but I wouldn't draft him as such                                                </div>

The worst part about Mariota is that he's declined in each of the last two seasons, as this is the time in his career where he's supposed to be coming into his own.

However, knowing what we do about rookie tight ends, it's best to just stream Fant when he has a good matchup rather than draft him                                                </div>

The Giants aren't going anywhere soon and Daniel Jones could use some time with the practice squad before being thrown into game action. The loss of Odell Beckham Jr. is huge, as Manning's splits with/without him are horrifying. He's not even a good selection in 2QB formats due to the fact he'll lose the starting job at some point.                                                </div>

While the Redskins did draft a few receivers, they've talked about taking snaps away from Josh Doctson, so it would even out a bit.

With Chris Hogan, Cordarrelle Patterson, and Rob Gronkowski out in New England, Tom Brady will need some familiarity. Dorsett didn't play a massive role last year, but when he was called upon, he delivered, catching 32-of-42 targets for 290 yards and three touchdowns. The Patriots did draft N'Keal Harry in the first-round, but there's no guarantee he starts in 2WR sets right now. This is a situation to monitor, as Dorsett is likely to make a few splash performances in 2019                                                </div>

Hurst was considered the more pro-ready player coming into the league, though Andrews played well enough in 2018 to create a timeshare. Hurst did add 20 pounds this offseason to help out as a blocker, which could keep him on the field a bit more, as Andrews is a poor blocker. Still, it's hard to see the Ravens produce a consistent tight end in 2019                                                </div>

As of now, you should gravitate towards the younger Wilkins who has experience in the offense and really got it together after a slow start in 2018. After just 136 yards on his first 38 carries (3.58 yards per carry), he totaled 200 yards on his next 22 carries (9.09 yards per carry). It's a small sample size, but it's an explosive offense that only got better as the year went on                                                </div>

It's possible that Benjamin finishes as a top-50 wide receiver in 2019, though his production will be a bit sporadic                                                </div>
