Some are excited about his target possibilities with Odell Beckham Jr. gone, but it's likely going to bring more attention to him and the run-game. Still, Barkley showed last year that he's able to overcome a lot, making him a safe top-three selection in every format                                                </div>

He's still likely to finish as a top-five option at the position even if he loses 4-6 touches per game, as he's gamescript-proof and it's not as if Cam Newton is rushing for as many touchdowns as he used to                                                </div>

He's likely going to walk into the old Ingram role, though it's important to note that it's no guarantee he's able to fit in this offense. You remember Adrian Peterson with the Saints, right? He was able to go to the Redskins and get it done, so maybe Sean Payton's offense just isn't right for everyone. Because of that, Kamara gets a slight bump in upside, which was already high to begin with, as he has finished as the RB3 and RB4 in his first two seasons with Ingram on the roster                                                </div>

With Kyler Murray presenting elusiveness, it should only help create lanes for Johnson, even if his offensive line is still weak                                                </div>

The issue is that the Browns are a franchise that has tons of talent on the defensive side of the ball, which may limit the amount of pass attempts to go around. Still, you don't trade for Beckham and not use him. He may not belong in the elite tier in year one with the Browns, but it shouldn't shock anyone if he finishes there. He is an outlier                                                </div>

He'll be playing behind a much lesser offensive line, with a much lesser quarterback, in a much worse offense. He's going to get plenty of touches, but we can say that about a lot of running backs. The question is - what's his upside in a low-scoring offense? Adam Gase's offenses have been lacking in both overall plays and overall scoring. Did you know that Dolphins running backs scored 10 rushing touchdowns over the last two years... combined? Bell is a relatively safe pick due to the touches he'll get, but he lacks the upside you want out of a high first-round pick                                                </div>

Anderson play over him during the playoffs, but the Rams also traded up to the start of the third-round to select Darrell Henderson, an explosive running back out of Memphis. The Rams also matched an offer sheet the Lions submitted to backup running back Malcolm Brown, meaning the Rams are more worried about Gurley than they're letting on. We all know Gurley comes with plenty of upside, but we also know you can't win your fantasy league in the first-round, but you can definitely help lose it                                                </div>

The Chiefs also signed Carlos Hyde, who happens to be a pretty good running back, though all many remember is that he didn't produce while on the Jaguars. If you were deciding between Hyde and Williams on the same roster at this point last year, Hyde would've been the no-brainer. Williams may be a stud, but he also comes with dud potential                                                </div>

Every time he has played 16 games, Green has finished among the top 10 fantasy receivers. Sure, there have been two injuries in the last three seasons, but he was still dominant up until those. If you pro-rate his 2018 numbers out to a full season, we were looking at a pace of 90 receptions, 1,374 yards and 12 scores. Friends, that would have placed him sixth among wide receivers in fantasy scoring, just between Julio Jones and Michael Thomas. Don't stop drafting him as anything other than a WR1 until he stops performing that way.                                                </div>

Because of that, he finished as the No. 4 wide receiver in fantasy from the time he joined them, behind only Antonio Brown, Davante Adams, and Julio Jones. He may not offer the consistency that those guys do, but not many do. Cooper should be on the low-end WR1 radar                                                </div>

They didn't add anyone to take targets away from them, outside of rookie tight end Irv Smith Jr., and we all know not to expect much out of rookie tight ends.

He's struggled to stay healthy to this point in his NFL career, but in this offense, he has legitimate top-five upside. He plays behind what might be the best offensive line in football and has one of the better quarterbacks in the league to take pressure off. If he stays healthy, he'll be worth more than a third-round pick                                                </div>

That's significant because that's the only year he played under Dirk Koetter, who is now back in Atlanta as the coordinator. While Freeman will have a much bigger role, Koetter hasn't been able to boost a run-game during his time in Atlanta or Tampa Bay, so the ceiling has likely dropped for Freeman. And that's not to mention Ito Smith, whose role grew as the year went on in 2018                                                </div>

With Mike Evans stealing quite a large share of the targets, you have to wonder just how high the ceiling is for Godwin, as the Bucs are likely going to run the ball a bit more under Arians. Godwin is a rock-solid player, but you mustn't forget that he's the No. 2 receiver on his team, and there's also a tight end (O.J. Howard) who deserves a lot of targets by his own right. It's okay to like Godwin in 2019, but keep expectations in check                                                </div>

Lewis is far-and-away the better pass-catcher, which means Henry will be gamescript-dependent. If you believe the Titans are contenders and will finish with a winning record, that's a vote of confidence for Henry, though it's hard to say that with any confidence. He's the ultimate boom-or-bust running back, which is why he's best-suited as an RB2                                                </div>

His teammate Curtis Samuel saw nearly the same target share in those weeks and actually offered more constant production. Moore is the superior player, but he'll also see more top-tier cornerbacks than Samuel will. With Cam Newton's hit-or-miss accuracy, Moore will definitely have some duds thrown in, which is why he's best-suited as a WR3 on your fantasy team                                                </div>

While some would expect him to build on that, the Falcons aren't likely to throw the ball as much as they did in 2018 due to their defensive stars being healthy again.

That's precisely the case with Lindsay, who will share some touches with Royce Freeman, but Lindsay has proven to be much more capable in the pass-game than Freeman, which gives him the nod as the starter. While there is some built-in risk, it's not enough to knock Lindsay out of solid RB2 territory                                                </div>

Green is/was and now he's dropping down draft boards while Boyd is skyrocketing up them. It's not to say Boyd will return to the waiver wire fodder he was his first two seasons in the league where he scored 15 PPR points just twice in 26 games, but he's not going to return to the player who saw seven or more targets in 9-of-14 games with Green back in the lineup. Do we really believe Andy Dalton can support two consistent top-24 receivers? That's what you're banking on with Boyd, because we know Green will be there if healthy. The only time Dalton has produced two top-30 receivers was in 2014, when Green missed three games, allowing Mohamed Sanu to finish as the WR29. It's not to say it's not possible Boyd takes a leap in the new offense, but he's being drafted at/near his ceiling without a Green injury                                                </div>

So, what does that say about Montgomery, who they traded up into the third-round to get? Howard finished as the RB20 in his first season under Matt Nagy. Montgomery was likely the best pure runner in the draft who's already shown the ability to handle a workhorse role, and offers more in the passing-game than Howard did, though most of that work will go to Tarik Cohen. Montgomery was drafted on a team that's built to win right now, which means he'll have big value immediately                                                </div>

From Week 12 on, he finished as the No. 4 fantasy running back behind only Christian McCaffrey, Derrick Henry, and Saquon Barkley. While Rashaad Penny is still there (and a former first-round pick), Mike Davis exited town, leaving behind plenty of touches for Penny. While Carson may not have the upside of others who are used in the pass-game consistently, he should be a solid RB2 provided he's healthy. This, of course, is a concern after hearing Carson "had a little work done" on his knee this offseason, so stay tuned for updates                                                </div>

Not only was it a small sample size (four weeks of top-notch production), but he has a new head coach (Adam Gase) who hasn't been kind to fantasy owners. On top of that, the Jets added Le'Veon Bell and Jamison Crowder to the pass-catching corps, which will take away some of the target upside for Anderson. While he's a solid player, you have to wonder if there'll be much consistency from this offense                                                </div>

Not only did Engram's target-share dip last year, but he also dealt with some injuries, leading him to finish outside the top-10 in his sophomore season. The expectation should be that he'll see 100-plus targets in 2019, which is something only 4-5 tight ends can say                                                </div>

Once the Browns got rid of Hue Jackson, Mayfield completed 68.4 percent of his passes and averaged 281.8 yards, 2.4 touchdowns, and 1.0 interception per game. The Browns added Odell Beckham this offseason, which definitely won't hurt. The reason to remain a bit wary of Mayfield taking the leap into elite territory is due to the defense getting much better and them running the ball a bit more to eat clock. He should present a high-floor for a middling QB1, however                                                </div>

It was Week 10 when Pettis turned into a full-time player, and from then until Week 16, he was the No. 20 wide receiver in fantasy, with Nick Mullens as his quarterback. The 49ers did add Deebo Samuel in the draft, but as we saw with Pettis, there's no guarantee he'll be a starter right away. Even if so, Jimmy Garoppolo returning to the lineup should only help his consistency in fantasy lineups                                                </div>

The addition of Keke Coutee is going to eat into his target share, but Fuller was always somewhat of a big-play threat who needed to get it done on limited targets.

Christian McCaffrey played extremely well around the goal-line, which takes away the thing that put Newton over the top as a fantasy quarterback - his rushing totals. Unless Newton can turn into a more polished passer, his days as a top-five quarterback are likely over                                                </div>

After seeing his pass attempts rise every year in the league, Wilson saw them dip down to just 427 of them in 2018. Losing Doug Baldwin surely won't help, though the addition of D.K. Metcalf won't hurt. Wilson is likely a lock to finish top-10 at his position, but his upside has diminished greatly                                                </div>

Sure, he's going to play with Drew Brees in New Orleans, but don't forget that he played with Aaron Rodgers just a few short years ago. Did you know that 2018 was the first time he scored more than five touchdowns in a season? Or how about that it was his first time topping 54 receptions or 759 yards? Over the last three years there hasn't been a running back/tight end duo who's topped 195 targets on the same team (the highest duo on the Saints has been just 151). Over the last two years, Kamara has totaled at least 100 targets, which tells you that Cook's ceiling is extremely limited                                                </div>

The addition of Odell Beckham surely isn't going to help him add to that target total, so he'll need to get more efficient in order to take the next step                                                </div>

He finished with just over 700 yards, which isn't horrible, but he now has a quarterback (Joe Flacco) who hasn't supported consistency out of wide receivers his entire career. On top of that, the Broncos moved to a defense-first head coach who'll want to run the ball a bit more often. It's tough to see Sutton overcoming some of these obstacles and breaking out in 2019                                                </div>

Think about teams like the Patriots or Bears, who seemingly always had someone different posting big fantasy days. Moving to a food reference: instead of figuring what pancake it will be, take the syrup that'll go over all of them. Many have labeled Chris Godwin and O.J. Howard as breakout candidates, and while I agree with them, Mike Evans is still there, too. Instead of trying to figure out which player is going to go off every week, take the guy who's distributing the ball to them. The addition of Bruce Arians is fantastic, as is the horrible defense that'll be out there, because you'll watch the pass attempts (and fantasy points) rack up                                                </div>

Those who say that will point to last year's finish, but Goff struggled prior to Gurley leaving the lineup, as he was in some sort of funk after their bye week (likely due to Cooper Kupp missing). Still, under Sean McVay, Goff has been a top-12 type performer in 14-of-31 games (45.2 percent), which may not sound like much, but it would rank 11th among quarterbacks the last two years. He's a low-end QB1/high-end QB2 who might see an increase in pass attempts this year                                                </div>

Still, McDonald was given a vote of confidence when the Steelers didn't draft a tight end in the first four rounds of what was considered a deep tight end class. Not much slides past me, but did you know McDonald saw 73 targets in 2018? That ranked 12th among tight ends and he finished as the No. 10 fantasy tight end. If McDonald stays on the field, he's absolutely locked-in for 90-plus targets and a top-eight finish in 2019                                                </div>

Now, his totals were inflated due to more passing than the Falcons wanted to do last year, as their defense was in shambles, forcing them to air it out against opponents. Hooper saw what was a career-high 88 targets because of that. With Calvin Ridley entering his second year, he figures to be more involved as well. Despite his top-six finish, Hooper posted top-12 type numbers just 37.5 percent of the time, which was tied with Jimmy Graham, and Trey Burton for 13th among tight ends, so there were some big performances to help him get there, and not so much consistency                                                </div>

The disparity in fantasy points per dropback isn't that large, so the more often he does it, the better, especially knowing he can rush for 500-plus yards.

Doug Pederson has allowed one running back to play more than 42 snaps in a game during his three years in Philadelphia: Darren Sproles, a do-it-all running back. Howard topped that number five times while with the Bears in 2018 alone with absolutely zero competition for the early-down role.

They also traded for Jordan Howard, who is likely to steal some goal-line work, as he was really good in that role with the Bears. Sanders is likely to end the year as a top-25 fantasy running back, but it'll likely be a bumpy road, similar to how it was with Jay Ajayi                                                </div>

While it's just a three-year sample size, Prescott has posted top-five type numbers in 22.9 percent of his games, while Brees is at 23.9 percent for his career. How about just top-12 type numbers? Prescott 47.9 percent, Brees at 48.9 percent. Don't devalue Prescott in fantasy, as he's a perfectly fine starter in 12-team leagues, particularly if you're stacked everywhere else                                                </div>

While he did finish as the No. 7 tight end, anyone who owned him can tell you it was frustrating. He played all 16 games, but he was hampered by some injuries at the end of the year. While year two could bring more consistency, we should have both Anthony Miller and Allen Robinson nearing full health, as they dealt with injuries as well in 2018. Burton isn't going to turn into Travis Kelce despite playing in the same offense, but he's still likely going to finish as a top-10 tight end at year's end                                                </div>

You've probably heard it a million times - Rivers has been a top-14 quarterback in 11-of-13 seasons, so you're drafting him at his floor if he's being taken as the QB14. Well, no. Rivers is a very consistent quarterback, but he's not going to help lead your team to a championship. There was just one game in 2018 where he totaled more than 24 fantasy points, and it's because his defense has continually gotten better. He also doesn't offer anything rushing, so unless his defense takes a step back in 2019, he's not going to have much of a chance to deliver much better numbers in 2019                                                </div>

Whatever the case, Henderson would likely share backup duties with Malcolm Brown should something cause Gurley to miss time.

The Colts have said they want Marlon Mack to carry most of the workload, but think of Hines like the Duke Johnson of their offense. He should offer RB4 numbers regularly in PPR formats, though he doesn't offer much upside, even if Mack were to miss time, as they'd share the workload between him, Spencer Ware, and Jordan Wilkins                                                </div>

That's going to provide a fantasy floor that you cannot find late in drafts. If you miss out on one of the high-tier quarterbacks you were aiming for, Jackson can help provide a stable floor while your stud running backs and wide receivers take care of the rest (because you took them instead of a quarterback in the higher rounds). From Week 11 forward, Jackson was the QB8 in fantasy, right in between Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson. If he develops more as a passer, his ceiling only gets higher                                                </div>

That's ahead of guys like Zach Ertz, Greg Olsen, and Hunter Henry. The issue has been staying on the field, as he's missed 31 games in his six years in the league. That's the only reason he's falling as far as he is in drafts. But once you get outside the top-seven or eight tight ends, you're likely going to wind-up streaming, so why not take a flier on a guy who presents top-five upside when healthy?                                                </div>

He's considered retirement multiple times, but maybe he's returning because his life is probably easier with D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel on the field? The bad news is that he's no longer the No. 1 target in the offense and he's continually losing targets to Christian McCaffrey, who set the record for receptions by a running back in 2018. Through 16 games the last two seasons, Olsen has seen a combined 76 targets, totaling 482 yards and five touchdowns. He has played through some injuries, so that's not exactly precise, but it's not far off from what you'll get out of him moving forward                                                </div>

Between them two, they posted 198.5 fantasy points over the 13 games that Garoppolo didn't play. Over the course of a full season, that would have amounted to the No. 16 quarterback. That was with Marquise Goodwin missing in action much of the time, with Pierre Garcon out for the year, and with Dante Pettis not getting on the field in a full-time role until the end of the season. Not only will Pettis be a full-time receiver, but the 49ers also drafted Deebo Samuel and Jalen Hurd inside the top three rounds. The running backs on the roster are all better pass-catchers than they are ball-carriers, which again favors Garoppolo                                                </div>

The Texans not drafting a running back to replace Lamar Miller was a vote of confidence in Foreman, but history hasn't been kind to players with these injuries                                                </div>

It was likely due to the fact that Aaron Rodgers had just 25 passing scores and finished with a career-low touchdown percentage. Year two should lead to more chemistry, and you should bet on Rodgers bouncing back                                                </div>

No. The offense has been completely overhauled, starting up top with the head coach Adam Gase, who turned Mike Gesicki into an afterthought in fantasy, though many experts had him as the top tight end in last year's class. The Jets also added Jamison Crowder and Le'Veon Bell, two players who'll take targets away from Herndon over the middle of the field. Gase's offense has produced less than 58 plays in two of his last three seasons and the Jets are likely to play solid defense with a ball-control style offense. That doesn't add up to much for last year's promising rookie                                                </div>

He's continually said he'd like to be, though the Browns aren't granting him his wish. Once Freddie Kitchens took over as the offensive coordinator last year, Johnson was much more involved in the passing game, totaling 33 targets in the final eight games. He didn't top four carries in any of those games, which definitely limits his ceiling. When drafting Johnson, your best scenario is him being traded to a team with a questionable starter in place. Outside of that, he's in Nyheim Hines/Dion Lewis territory                                                </div>

Then Kearse took over and proceeded to get 48 targets over the next six weeks. The point is that Sam Darnold does like his slot receiver and the Jets signed Crowder very early in free agency, highlighting the need. He's just not a sexy pick, which is why the consensus is lower on him                                                </div>

Only Allen and Josh Rosen completed less than 57.7 percent of their passes. Combine the low completion percentage with a run-first offense and you're going to have a lot of ups and downs with Brown, but more downs                                                </div>

Unless they bench their leading receiver last year (Zay Jones), Foster won't be on the field very much. It's possible he overtakes Jones, but do you really want the third option on a run-first team. Pass on Foster and let someone else cut him after the first few weeks                                                </div>

It doesn't matter if he's there in the 13th round, let someone else take on that burden. Not only is he suspended for the first eight games of the season, but he's behind a guy who rushed for nearly 1,000 yards despite not starting until Week 7. Did I mention that running back was also drafted by the Browns at the start of the second-round in 2018? The first four weeks of the season are the most important weeks of the season for the waiver wire, so why hold yourself hostage with a guy who's not even a lock to play once his suspension is over? Not to mention bye week issues you'll have. On top of that, you've never seen him outside a Chiefs offense, where every running back put in the lineup succeeds. I'm not saying he's not a good player, but Chubb is better                                                </div>

Samuels was never meant to be a 20-plus touch back, but he's likely going to be involved much more, even when James Conner is healthy. The issue is that Snell is a threat to his upside and would likely be the primary back if Conner were to go down with an injury. Because of that, Samuels may be locked into a Chris Thompson/Giovani Bernard type role, which doesn't do much for your fantasy team. Unless we hear he's the primary backup, he's not someone you should roster                                                </div>

This isn't to say Cooper is on Brown's level, but more to do with Carr's inability to be consistent. He's performed at a top-12 level in just 29.5 percent of his 78 career games, which is worse than the career of DeShone Kizer and Blake Bortles. Even if he steps up his passing, his lack of rushing totals severely caps his upside. He's not a bad option in 2QB leagues for those who wait, as he has no chance of being benched, but stay away in standard leagues                                                </div>

It's because he's been durable and has had little-to-no chance of being benched. The early reports out of camp say that Ryan Finley has looked pretty bad, meaning Dalton will once again be entrenched as the starter. If you're in a 2QB league, he'll suffice. If you're in a standard 1QB league, he's streaming material in good matchups                                                </div>

Anderson carry the Rams offense at the end of last season, he settled for a one-year deal with the Lions to play alongside the up-and-coming Kerryon Johnson. The Lions do want to use a timeshare, so it's likely Anderson inherits the LeGarrette Blount role in the offense, which netted 164 touches last year, though it helped that Johnson missed time at the end of the year. If you combined Blount and Zach Zenner's roles from last year, they netted 209 carries, 683 yards, and eight touchdowns on the ground. Anderson is going to clog upside on your bench as long as Johnson is in the lineup. If Johnson were to miss time, Anderson would likely be considered a low-end RB2                                                </div>

Hockenson this year, as the Broncos receiving corps is likely to be without Emmanuel Sanders to start the year, and they have Joe Flacco at the helm, who's always gravitated towards his tight ends. Fant has a ways to go in his blocking, but as a receiver, he should be able to contribute right away. However, knowing what we do about rookie tight ends, it's best to just stream Fant when he has a good matchup rather than draft him                                                </div>

That was until they moved up in the third-round and drafted workhorse David Montgomery. The Bears were lacking depth behind Howard and Tarik Cohen last year, and although Davis is high-priced depth, it's hard to imagine him getting more than 5-8 touches per game with Montgomery and Cohen healthy. He is, however, one of the better handcuffs, as he's a capable three-down back who'd walk into RB2 production with an injury in front of him                                                </div>

Outside of his bye week (and potential injury), Foles can be in your lineup. Understand that his upside is nearly non-existent without a true No. 1 receiver or tight end, and on a team who is going to be run-heavy. He'll likely finish as a top-24 quarterback due to his job security, but I wouldn't draft him as such                                                </div>

When on the field, Eifert has been extremely solid, but there's been a new offense installed in Cincinnati. Now dealing with competition between A.J. Green, Tyler Boyd, Joe Mixon, and John Ross, it's unlikely Eifert will ever get the targets needed to become a consistent fantasy option                                                </div>

Hurst was considered the more pro-ready player coming into the league, though Andrews played well enough in 2018 to create a timeshare. Hurst did add 20 pounds this offseason to help out as a blocker, which could keep him on the field a bit more, as Andrews is a poor blocker. Still, it's hard to see the Ravens produce a consistent tight end in 2019                                                </div>

The Giants aren't going anywhere soon and Daniel Jones could use some time with the practice squad before being thrown into game action. The loss of Odell Beckham Jr. is huge, as Manning's splits with/without him are horrifying. He's not even a good selection in 2QB formats due to the fact he'll lose the starting job at some point.                                                </div>

Riddick is still likely to be involved, but he's not someone who'll help you win a fantasy title, even if there's an injury because he wouldn't walk into a workhorse role. He's a guy to help fill bye weeks in PPR formats, but not much more                                                </div>

Landing in Detroit was ideal, as Matthew Stafford has loved his slot option throughout his career, including last year when they brought in Bruce Ellington off the street to fill Golden Tate's shoes. He tallied 30 targets in four games with the team, catching 23 of them for 132 yards. While it wasn't massive production, volume is key with PPR receivers like Amendola. If you're looking for someone to help fill bye weeks, don't be shocked if Amendola is a popular waiver wire add at that time                                                </div>

With Chris Hogan, Cordarrelle Patterson, and Rob Gronkowski out in New England, Tom Brady will need some familiarity. Dorsett didn't play a massive role last year, but when he was called upon, he delivered, catching 32-of-42 targets for 290 yards and three touchdowns. The Patriots did draft N'Keal Harry in the first-round, but there's no guarantee he starts in 2WR sets right now. This is a situation to monitor, as Dorsett is likely to make a few splash performances in 2019                                                </div>

The Steelers obviously felt otherwise, as they selected him to back-up James Conner in the fourth-round of the draft.

Without an injury to Conner, though, it's unlikely Snell sees many touches                                                </div>

As of now, you should gravitate towards the younger Wilkins who has experience in the offense and really got it together after a slow start in 2018. After just 136 yards on his first 38 carries (3.58 yards per carry), he totaled 200 yards on his next 22 carries (9.09 yards per carry). It's a small sample size, but it's an explosive offense that only got better as the year went on                                                </div>

I'd argue it's best for him to start all season with the state of the team while letting Haskins get some much needed reps with the backups. Keenum offers nothing with his legs, which means all production will have to come through the air. The issue is that he's got little-to-nothing in the pass-catching department. He's nothing more than an emergency QB3                                                </div>

As of now, it's got to be treated as if Pollard will get the first shot at it. They took Pollard in the fourth-round, then took Mike Weber in the seventh-round, which is quite the gap. Pollard was viewed as a versatile weapon who could be used on special teams, at running back, and at wide receiver, so it's possible they want Weber in the backup role, while Pollard plays a universal role. This is a backfield to pay attention to in the preseason, as Ezekiel Elliott's handcuff is worth quite a bit.                                                </div>

If it were to happen, Griffin would step right in and likely assume a similar role. While he isn't the greatest passer, his throwing is more advanced that Jackson's which would add up to a nice QB2 with his rushing ability and likely volume.                                                </div>

Shoulder injuries are a beast, and despite Cam being a competitor, it would be wise for Carolina to take their time with him, lest he re-injure it. Whichever way you slice it, Grier seems likely to get a few starts in 2019 with weapons at his disposal.                                                </div>
