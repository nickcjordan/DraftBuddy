Despite missing a game, he led the league in completions but also tied for the most sacks taken. He\u2019s a yardage monster averaging over 4,500 passing yards for the last nine seasons. Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley are one of the top tandems in the NFL and the additions of Todd Gurley and Hayden Hurst should give him dependable secondary options. If the offensive line improves in the slightest, Ryan is in consideration as a top-10 guy if the TDs fall his way in 2020.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336220243\/31e32af513"},"1410":{"id":"6","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"1410","blurb":"","video":null},"1658":{"id":"7","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 17:35:10","player_id":"1658","blurb":"He certainly feels like \u201cold busted.\u201d However, he did put up nearly 600 yards with trash QB play, Seattle gave him a 1-year contract worth almost $7 million, and Russell Wilson does use a pass catching TE. Olsen at least has a chance to have value.","video":null},"1694":{"id":"8","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"1694","blurb":"","video":null},"2982":{"id":"9","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"2982","blurb":"","video":null},"3253":{"id":"10","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"3253","blurb":"","video":null},"3258":{"id":"11","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"3258","blurb":"","video":null},"3388":{"id":"12","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"3388","blurb":"","video":null},"3807":{"id":"13","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 15:02:14","player_id":"3807","blurb":"The entire Steelers offense collapsed after Big Ben went down last year in Week 2. Almost a year removed from surgery, Roethlisberger should be able to support Juju Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson, and newly signed Eric Ebron in the passing game. He\u2019s just one year removed from leading the league in completions, attempts, passing yards, and INTs. If the volume is there, he\u2019s always worth a shot as a late-round QB with two to three nuclear fantasy performances looming. The Steelers open the season at the Giants, an intriguing Week 1 matchup to pounce on.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336222951\/83be18fbb3"},"3943":{"id":"14","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 08:27:04","player_id":"3943","blurb":"Jackson had a monster Week 1 in his 2019 return to the Eagles. However, injuries made him miss most of the season. He\u2019ll enter the season at 33 years old and hasn\u2019t played a full season in years. The Eagles traded for speedster Marquise Goodwin and selected Jalen Reagor in the 1st Round so DJax might be ancillary in Philly.","video":null},"4314":{"id":"15","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 15:02:40","player_id":"4314","blurb":"Embrace Brady in Tampa Bay or continue with the disdain and hatred of the ex-Patriots QB. Whether you think he is done or not, Brady had the 4th most passing attempts and the 5th most 20+ yard completions in the league. He also posted the lowest TD rate (3.9%) of his career but New England\u2019s weapons pale in comparison to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. With Rob Gronkowski along for the ride, Brady has the coach (Bruce Arians) and motivation to excel with the Buccaneers and finish as a QB1.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336223039\/f417921398"},"4807":{"id":"16","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-27 11:38:35","player_id":"4807","blurb":"Peterson was slated to be the backup to Derrius Guice, but another injury thrust Peterson into the starting role again. He continues to defy time and produce for his teams but the end could be coming for Peterson. AP could find himself as the odd-man out in Washington. The team will attempt to have Guice be the starter again, they added Antonio Gibson in the 3rd, as well as picking up a few other vets. Then again, things just keep working out for Peterson.","video":null},"4932":{"id":"17","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2019-05-27 19:05:00","player_id":"4932","blurb":"It\u2019s hard to make a case for Eli that doesn\u2019t start with, \u2018well, he doesn\u2019t miss games\u2019. He generally surpasses the 4k yardage mark, but has seen his TD production drop to levels where it\u2019s difficult to even want to stream him. Now the omnipotent Dave Gettleman has traded away the Giants' best WR and replaced him with a 30-year-old slot WR. The only reason Eli is on your fantasy team is if you play in a Superflex league and you need depth.","video":null},"5571":{"id":"18","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-24 16:48:38","player_id":"5571","blurb":"Larry Legend returns for another season.

He\u2019s had over 800 receiving yards in four of those five. Walker is about as not exciting as it gets to walk away with on draft day. Even with the additions of Corey Davis and A.J. Brown, it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where Walker is a flat-out bust. If you don\u2019t like early TEs but you also don\u2019t like streaming the position, if Walker is healthy and ready to go he\u2019s a fine value pick.","video":null},"7242":{"id":"24","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 14:53:00","player_id":"7242","blurb":"Despite playing just 11 games, Brees was as efficient as ever throwing 27 TDs and leading the league in completion percentage for the third year in a row. With Taysom Hill knocking on the door and Jameis Winston also waiting in the wings, Brees is entering his age 41 season, nearing the end for an all-timer. The Footballers are all-in on Drew Brees at his draft price in 2020.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336223005\/c8346f1d72"},"7884":{"id":"25","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"7884","blurb":"","video":null},"8244":{"id":"26","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 15:03:04","player_id":"8244","blurb":"It\u2019s going to be a strange sight watching Rivers sidearm heave his way in a non-Chargers uniform in 2020. With a one year deal as Frank Reich\u2019s QB in Indianapolis, Rivers finds himself behind one of the league\u2019s best offensive lines. Last year Rivers attempted the 4th most \u201cdeep passes\u201d of 20+ yards in the league but completed only 27-of-79 of them. Nine of those attempts went for INTs, which led the league. You know what you\u2019re getting: Rivers will force the ball often and check down to his RBs like it\u2019s going out of style. He\u2019s a streamable QB in the right matchups but not someone to depend on each week.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336223018\/5c498f9c32"},"8355":{"id":"27","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-23 19:46:45","player_id":"8355","blurb":"While 2019 was not ideal for the Patriots, it was Julian Edelman\u2019s best fantasy season yet with 100 receptions and the most yards of his career (1117). When has Julian Edelman played a season without Tom Brady? Never. That makes the entire offense a huge question mark as Edelman enters the season at 34 years old. Still, the fantasy football WR10 from last year is being drafted outside the top 30 wide receivers this year.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/338113957\/5c91eb8f9f"},"8534":{"id":"28","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-25 01:27:10","player_id":"8534","blurb":"Cook ended the year as the TE7, but was the TE3 from Week 5 on. The rapport he found with Drew Brees as the season ended was outstanding, and while the team added Emmanuel Sanders, Cook should remain a high priority in the passing game. Fantasy owners with burns from Jared Cook's past failures have left him further down draft boards than he belongs.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336910643\/db9bd1211f"},"8750":{"id":"29","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"8750","blurb":"","video":null},"9038":{"id":"30","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 16:40:06","player_id":"9038","blurb":"Poor Matty Snapback. He was on pace for almost 5,000 yards and over 30 TDs before his back gave out. We saw the resurgence of the old Stafford of the Calvin Johnson days past: he was second in the league in aDOT and had the highest percentage of \u201cend-zone\u201d throws. In other words, Stafford was focused on the money-making targets for fantasy which clearly benefited Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones Jr. He\u2019ll be undervalued once again in drafts and is worth a shot as a double-digit round QB in 2020.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/423824368\/463d6f187f"},"9331":{"id":"31","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-23 19:50:55","player_id":"9331","blurb":"placeholder","video":null},"9906":{"id":"32","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 08:32:54","player_id":"9906","blurb":"Amendola returns as the slot receiver for Matthew Stafford and the Lions. Beyond a super deep desperation play in PPR leagues, he\u2019s not worth rostering in fantasy.","video":null},"10333":{"id":"33","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"10333","blurb":"","video":null},"10974":{"id":"34","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 17:31:16","player_id":"10974","blurb":"He\u2019s baaaaack! The last time we saw Gronk really smashing was back in 2017. It\u2019s possible the time off during his one-year retirement let his body fully heal. It\u2019s also possible people expect too much from a rusty Gronk heading into a new offensive system that hasn\u2019t shown much reliance on pass-catching tight ends. If he\u2019s healthy, it\u2019s really hard to see him not finishing in the top 10 at the position. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to envision him finishing where we are used to in the top 3.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/423831579\/cdb9167500"},"11056":{"id":"35","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 16:12:48","player_id":"11056","blurb":"placeholder","video":null},"11063":{"id":"36","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 08:06:41","player_id":"11063","blurb":"Sanders goes to possibly the best landing spot possible in free agency joining the Saints. While his age (33) may concern some, he actually played ALL 17 weeks last season because of being traded midseason from the Broncos to the 49ers. Coming back and fighting through injuries, he still showed big play ability last season.

During his first two years in the league, he was on 5 different teams. It wasn\u2019t until his 4th year in the league that he saw five total carries in a game. Then Week 12-17 of 2019 he was the RB7 in fantasy and posted the 2nd most rushing yards of all-time in a playoff game. Mostert plays for an offensive guru, behind a strong offensive line, on a run-heavy team. He\u2019s going to put up insane fantasy games and frustratingly bad ones when teammate Tevin Coleman goes off. However, if the team really commits to him, Mostert will be amazing.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/423812919\/1de139d7c5"},"20841":{"id":"713","created_at":"2020-05-13 17:38:52","updated_at":"2020-06-17 09:30:53","player_id":"20841","blurb":"Jones decided to drop kick all of his naysayers last year showcasing the type of upside as a runner and playmaking ability as a rookie that many failed to see when he was drafted sixth overall.

Jones had many 4+ pass TD games this year as Michael Vick & Troy Aikman had in their entire careers. There were also some major blunders as Jones fumbled 18 times in 13 games played.

<h3>
Kyler Murray, <span class="team">ARI</span>
</h3>
<p>
Each of the last few years we've seen a player emerge from a quality fantasy quarterback to a fantasy superstar. Murray's opportunity is before him, as the team has improved the offensive line and brought in arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL in DeAndre Hopkins. Murray gives fantasy owners a huge baseline with his rushing numbers, and last year the Cardinals converted so rarely inside the red zone that his fantasy numbers were deflated significantly. If his touchdown % can increase (likely with the addition of Hopkins and the return of Kenyan Drake) then Murray is primed for a breakout 2020. </p>

<h3>
Josh Allen, <span class="team">BUF</span>
</h3>
<p>
Much like Kyler Murray, Allen has an opportunity to improve upon his rushing baseline due to elite WR talent being added to the offense. Stefon Diggs is one of the NFL's best at getting open deep, and Allen boasts one of the biggest arms in the NFL. Connecting more regularly with his WR will inflate the rushing baseline Allen brings to the table, and hopefully give fantasy owners more week-winning performances in 2020. A breakout is coming as the Bills vie for a now possible division title. </p>

<h3>
Josh Jacobs, <span class="team">LV</span>
</h3>
<p>
Josh Jacobs is a three-down back that simply did not receive the level of pass-game work fantasy owners hoped for last year. In 2020 look for him to be even more involved and add to his elite rookie year production. Coming off an injury-laden 242/1150/7 campaign, Jacobs will be the centerpiece of a viable Oakland offense. He's everything you want in an emerging feature back. </p>

<h3>
Kenyan Drake, <span class="team">ARI</span>
</h3>
<p>
Need a refresher on how good Kenyan Drake was once he arrived in Arizona last season? He was the RB4 from week 9 on, a perfect fit for the Kliff Kingsburg/Kyler Murray offense. He returns on a new contract for 2020 and slides right into the emerging offense as a dual threat RB. He's simply not being drafted near his ceiling right now and has breakout potential in 2020 in an offense that boasts a near league leading plays-per-game total. </p>

<h3>
Miles Sanders, <span class="team">PHI</span>
</h3>
<p>
Miles Sanders broke out to end the 2019 season, and fantasy owners are left holding their breath when it comes to 2020. Will the Eagles add another RB? Will the team be willing to give Miles a feature role? This team invested it's highest draft capital on Sanders since LeSean McCoy was drafted, and Miles delivered to end the year. If the backfield depth chart stays status quo, it should be a big year for Sanders in 2020, who was the RB8 from Week 12 on last year. </p>

<h3>
Calvin Ridley, <span class="team">ATL</span>
</h3>
<p>
If there's one player that all three guys seem to be "in" on this year, it's Calvin Ridley. Austin Hooper is gone, Mohamed Sanu is gone, Davonta Freeman is gone. Ridley enters his year three breakout season looking like this year's Chris Godwin. With 17 touchdowns in his first two years, Ridley has a knack for big plays and should have plenty of opportunities for his first 1000 yard season in 2020. While Julio is the lead dog of the offense, Ridley could push for "best value" in terms of average draft position and fantasy production. </p>

<h3>
Marquise Brown, <span class="team">BAL</span>
</h3>
<p>
A big play machine, the question marks surrounding Hollywood Brown will all circle around his opportunity in the offense. A hyper-talented speed demon, Brown will need to stay healthy and receive consistent targets from Lamar Jackson to evolve and breakout in 2020. He represents a higher risk, high reward breakout candidate who could emerge as a Tyreek Hill like value if given the opportunity. </p>

<h3>
Terry McLaurin, <span class="team">WAS</span>
</h3>
<p>
Andy will have no part in this breakout prediction, but both Jason and Mike love the opportunity McLaurin has moving into year two. While Haskins is an issue, McLaurin proved that consistent QB play was no stumbling block for him in 2019, delivering several highly meaningful performances for fantasy owners. If Haskins can take a step forward, Terry McLaurin looks like the clear cut WR1 on this team and will have every opportunity to prove it. </p>

<h3>
Evan Engram, <span class="team">NYG</span>
</h3>
<p>
The only thing that stands between Evan Engram and fantasy glory is Evan Engram. An elite big-play tight end, Engram has dealt with consistent injury issues throughout his playing days thus far. Despite this, he remains as a breakout candidate for 2020 due to the sheer pace he maintains when active and on the field. Much like George Kittle in San Francisco, Engram can score from anywhere on the field and is a quarterback's best friend. It all comes down to health, but Mike in particular is banking on Engram bouncing back in a big way in 2020. </p>

<h3>
Noah Fant, <span class="team">DEN</span>
</h3>
<p>
Consider this one an Andy special. While Jason and Mike saw the upside of Noah Fant last year, it's Andy who's calling for the breakout season in 2020. Fant was the 20th overall pick in the first round last year, a dynamic pass catcher who showed he can turn a small reception into a big gain in a hurry. Coming into year two, Fant should take another big step forward as a focal point of a rebuilt offense in Denver. Don't sleep on a year two breakout from Noah Fant. </p>

<h3>
Mike Gesicki, <span class="team">MIA</span>
</h3>
<p>
It took a while but we finally saw the ability and talent of Mike Gesicki over the back half of 2019. From week 9 on, Gesicki was the tight end #7 on the year, and closed the season on fire. The former #42 overall pick from Penn State, Gesicki emerged and looks to capitalize on the great finish with a solid 2020 campaign. There are a handful of tight ends each year with both the talent and opportunity to break out, and Gesicki fits that mold in 2020. </p>
