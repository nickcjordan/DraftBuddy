However, if you think he's a breakout candidate to finish as a top-five running back, you're betting against the odds. Among the running backs who finished top-10 last year, just two of them finished there while seeing fewer than 39 targets. Those two running backs were Derrick Henry and Nick Chubb, who averaged 5.4 and 5.6 yards per carry, numbers no one can actually project to hit. They also scored 17 and 12 touchdowns on the ground, propping their numbers up. Dobbins saw just 24 targets last year, a number that's unlikely to move much considering he's in the same offense with the same quarterback, only with more weapons around him. If Dobbins can rush for over 5.0 yards per carry (he did last year) and score double-digit rushing touchdowns (again, hard to project), he's going to finish as a top-10 running back, but not top-five due to the lack of work in the passing game.

Well, he caught 70.4 percent of his targets... at 15.9 yards a pop. No other wide receiver in the history of the game has totaled 1,400 yards on 125 or less targets. Bottom line... he needs more targets if he's going to live up to expectations because that's unlikely to happen again. With the defense getting back on track with Danielle Hunter (and adding in free agency), do the Vikings trend back to their run-heavy ways? Adam Thielen is a year older, but the chemistry between him and Kirk Cousins is magical. The sky is the limit for Jefferson with his talent, but will the targets follow?

Have the 49ers lost patience? They traded up to draft Trey Sermon in the third round, which could indicate they're ready to move on from Mostert, or it could be them ensuring they have a high-quality backup for if/when he gets injured. Mostert tallied at least 14 carries in 5-of-8 starts last year, which is more than enough to get into RB2 territory with his efficiency, but you can't draft him as such when injuries/Sermon are factored in. He's not someone you can confidently draft as a starter for your fantasy team because there's so much unknown. However, if he gets the job back, this is a pick that can make a difference in fantasy leagues. The 49ers have one of the easiest schedules in the league, so if they let Mostert get rolling, he's unlikely to slow down.

The Raiders have continually given guys like DeAndre Washington, Jalen Richard, and Devontae Booker work alongside Jacobs over the last two years, so Drake is going to get mixed in quite heavily, and my guess would be that the passing game is where he gets most of it.

It's tough to see him eating into Jacobs' carry totals a whole lot, especially after the way he looked with the Cardinals in 2020, but he should offer low-upside flex value due to his work in the passing game.

The Raiders decided to pay Kenyan Drake a good chunk of money to come in and share the workload with Jacobs, forcing his fantasy stock to plummet. Drake was essentially the same running back as Jacobs last year, though we've seen him produce in the passing game before. Did the addition of Drake drop Jacobs' price too far, or is this a backfield to simply avoid if possible?

In addition, if Etienne is just as efficient in the NFL as he was in college (both as a rusher and a receiver), he might not need 15+ touches per game to return RB2 value even in Year One.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"17297":{"fantasyProsId":"17297","tier":8,"playerName":"Nyheim Hines","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"14","team":"COLTS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-114,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-5","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"B","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"],"handcuffs":"Jonathan Taylor, Jordan Wilkins","backups":[{"fantasyProsId":"19217","tier":2,"playerName":"Jonathan Taylor","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"14","team":"COLTS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-6,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-5","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":15,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"36"},{"name":"YDS","value":"299"},{"name":"TDS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"36"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"299"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"232"},{"name":"YDS","value":"1169"},{"name":"TDS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"232"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"11"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"1169"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"216.8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"216.8"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"217","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"14.5","priorTotalTargets":"40","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"2.7","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"20"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"20"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"29"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"29"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"16"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"16"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"19"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"19"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"37"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"37"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"11","positionRank":"8","bestRank":"3","worstRank":"40","avgRank":"11.79","stdDev":"5.74","adp":"6","vsAdp":"-5","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/agkckg1y09l6slgie9jt","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/agkckg1y09l6slgie9jt","picLocation":"/images/players/JonathanTaylor.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"3 days ago","text":"This time last year, I was much higher on Taylor than the consensus.

days ago","text":"Let's do an exercise... How many targets per game do you anticipate Beckham getting this year? I'm going with an extremely low number and say he averages 6.5 targets per game. That sounds more than reasonable, right? Beckham had 7.0 targets per game during the 2020 season before getting hurt and that includes a three-target game against the Steelers. The Browns were also throwing the ball a lot less early in the year as Baker Mayfield was still getting grasp on Kevin Stefanski's playbook. If Beckham gets 6.5 targets per game, that'd put him on pace for 104 targets, which again, is what I'd consider low. There were just 32 receivers in the NFL who hit that number last year, with 24 of them (75 percent) finishing as top-24 receivers and just two finishing worse than WR38. You mean to tell me with Beckham's talent, he can't produce top-24 numbers? There's health risks for sure, but there's also top-five wide receiver upside.

Dating back to 2014, his injury history includes a fractured fibula, a hamstring strain, a quad strain, sports hernia repair surgery and most recently a torn ACL. He’ll be 29 in November, which is important given that there is a statistically significant difference in the rate of soft tissue injuries in players that are age 26 and younger and we know from research studies that younger NFL players tend to have better performance outcomes following ACL surgery.

While I don't expect him to get there, he's one of just two running backs (Christian McCaffrey is the other) who I'm projecting for 100-plus targets in 2021. Targets are worth twice as much as carries, so even if Ekeler winds up getting just 12 carries per game, it's not the end of the world. In fact, he can still finish as a borderline RB1 if he were to hit just 200 carries on the season. The new coaching staff obviously brings on some potential volatility, but there's not much other talent on the roster at running back, so his role should be very safe.

He'll be significantly down in drafts, so could be worth the late round flyer as New England's de facto #1.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}}]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"59"},{"name":"YDS","value":"729"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"59"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"729"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"2"},{"name":"YDS","value":"9"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"2"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"9"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"83.52"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"83.52"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"84","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"7.0","priorTotalTargets":"81","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"5.8","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"190","positionRank":"73","bestRank":"113","worstRank":"346","avgRank":"203.02","stdDev":"36.62","adp":"295","vsAdp":"105","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/f5idogoceqx4aocya3b5","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/f5idogoceqx4aocya3b5","picLocation":"/images/players/JakobiMeyers.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"3 days ago","text":"With Julian Edelman out of New England, we might see Meyers be the receiver to step into that role, though the lack of clarity with the quarterback situation is what will supress our optimism.

He fell off a cliff after that, leading fantasy managers to search for new options in 2021, but there might be a reason to head back to the well. With the addition of A.J. Green, it's likely we see Kirk move to the slot, which is where I believe he should've been playing all along. Despite being inefficient and limited in athleticism at his advanced age, Larry Fitzgerald saw 112, 109, and 72 targets as the primary slot receiver over the last three years under Kliff Kingsbury. If Kirk can get near the 100-target mark, he'll be a value in drafts.

The Eagles now clearly have Devonta Smith and Jalen Reagor ahead of him on the depth chart, but if Jalen Hurts can take a step forward in his passing in 2021, we could see Fulgham have a few usable weeks in fantasy as the team's No. 3 receiver.

Opportunity is everything, and if he gets that type of opportunity again in 2021 while playing in all the games, he's going to finish as a top-15 running back. The only difference is that the Dolphins added Malcolm Brown in free agency, which could lead to him siphoning some targets away from Gaskin, which would be less than ideal.

It’s possible Samuel’s hamstring issues stemmed from the fact that he wasn’t able to train optimally last summer while recovering from foot surgery. Entering 2021, he’ll be fully recovered from both his foot fracture and his hamstring issue, but it’s worth noting that he has a history of at least two separate hamstring injuries dating back to his college days. Relative to the other big name 49ers pass catchers (Aiyuk, Kittle), Deebo’s the biggest risk from a health perspective.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"17270":{"fantasyProsId":"17270","tier":7,"playerName":"Dallas Goedert","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"14","team":"EAGLES","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-75,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"even","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"^","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-link"],"handcuffs":"Zach Ertz","backups":[{"fantasyProsId":"11689","tier":10,"playerName":"Zach Ertz","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"14","team":"EAGLES","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-161,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-5","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"B","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":11,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"36"},{"name":"YDS","value":"335"},{"name":"TDS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"36"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"335"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"41.5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"41.5"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"42","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"3.8","priorTotalTargets":"72","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"6.5","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"166","positionRank":"23","bestRank":"53","worstRank":"299","avgRank":"178.24","stdDev":"34.03","adp":"161","vsAdp":"-5","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/icuoo1jw9otwklr1xudr","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/icuoo1jw9otwklr1xudr","picLocation":"/images/players/ZachErtz.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"BUST","text":"There just aren't any good outcomes for Zach Ertz this year.

Bad offensive scheme? Or was it Reagor himself? It may have been a combination of all three things, though the other two have changed this offseason, as Nick Sirianni is now the head coach, and Jalen Hurts is now the quarterback. The downside is that the Eagles drafted Devonta Smith in the first round and he's immediately going to become the No. 1 target for Hurts, which puts Reagor into competition with Dallas Goedert as the No. 2 option in this offense. If Hurts pans out, Reagor could be a value later in drafts, though he may be a bit more boom/bust than you'd like due to his inconsistent targets.

He joins a backfield with Miles Sanders, Boston Scott, Kerryon Johnson, and Jordan Howard.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},{"fantasyProsId":"18283","tier":5,"playerName":"Miles Sanders","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"14","team":"EAGLES","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-34,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-5","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"B","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"28"},{"name":"YDS","value":"197"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"28"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"197"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"164"},{"name":"YDS","value":"867"},{"name":"TDS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"164"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"6"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"867"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"142.4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"142.4"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"142","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"11.9","priorTotalTargets":"52","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"4.3","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"22"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"22"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"26"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"26"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"43","positionRank":"19","bestRank":"23","worstRank":"71","avgRank":"43.35","stdDev":"8.31","adp":"34","vsAdp":"-9","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/m1lscxsubhwr0oz4gp45","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/m1lscxsubhwr0oz4gp45","picLocation":"/images/players/MilesSanders.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"3 days ago","text":"The start to Sanders' career hasnt been what we'd hoped for, delivering RB2 or better numbers in just 14-of-28 of games (50 percent).

By all accounts, Barkley is progressing as expected and is likely to be ready for Week 1, but the Giants will reportedly take it slow with their star RB at the start of training camp. He’ll have had 10+ months of rehab prior to the start of the season, but his year could get off to a slower start given that the meniscus repair requires a longer recovery timeline. All in all, however, research suggests that RBs coming off ACL surgery are more likely to return to form if: 1) They are age 24 or younger, 2) They have 1st or 2nd round NFL Draft capital, and 3) They’re athletic. Saquon checks all three boxes and should still return to 100% this season.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"18571":{"fantasyProsId":"18571","tier":15,"playerName":"Alec Ingold","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"8","team":"RAIDERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-999,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":null,"roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"12"},{"name":"YDS","value":"110"},{"name":"TDS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"12"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"110"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"3"},{"name":"YDS","value":"4"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"3"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"4"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"17.400000000000002"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"17.400000000000002"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"17","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"1.5","priorTotalTargets":"17","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"1.1","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"457","positionRank":"131","bestRank":"274","worstRank":"277","avgRank":"275.50","stdDev":"1.50","adp":"1000","vsAdp":null,"rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/keof98crgl8eiscdvapt","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/keof98crgl8eiscdvapt","picLocation":"/images/players/AlecIngold.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[]}},"19781":{"fantasyProsId":"19781","tier":10,"playerName":"Justin Fields","position":"QUARTERBACK","bye":"10","team":"BEARS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-158,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"R","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-registration-mark"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":null,"priorAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalTargets":null,"priorAverageTargetsPerGame":null,"priorStatsByWeekNumber":{}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"169","positionRank":"24","bestRank":"95","worstRank":"358","avgRank":"180.24","stdDev":"52.98","adp":"158","vsAdp":"-11","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":null,"smallPicLink":"https://images.fantasypros.com/images/players/nfl/19781/headshot/70x70.png","picLocation":"/images/players/JustinFields.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"ROOKIE","text":"The tumble to pick 11 was unforeseen by many draft pundits but the ammo that Chicago unloaded to move up nine spots shows you just how desperate this team was to jump on Fields.

","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Parris Campbell missed virtually all of his rookie season in 2019 with three separate surgeries - a broken hand, a broken foot and a sports hernia repair. Then, in Week 2 of last season, Campbell suffered a sprained MCL and PCL in his left knee. Yet another season-ending surgery for Campbell ended his 2020 campaign early. Recent reports indicate Campbell has been cleared for full participation in the team’s offseason program, which makes sense given that the typical recovery timeline for this injury is 6-9 months. The injury history looks scary on paper, but there is nothing in his profile that suggests these injuries are correlated in any way.","source":"Fantasy

To this point in his career, Kittle has dealt with injury in every professional season but his injuries have primarily come as a blocker or defenseless receiver, suggesting he’s been more unlucky than “injury prone.”","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"16378":{"fantasyProsId":"16378","tier":8,"playerName":"Leonard Fournette","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"9","team":"BUCCANEERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-76,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"36"},{"name":"YDS","value":"233"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"36"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"233"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"97"},{"name":"YDS","value":"367"},{"name":"TDS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"97"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"6"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"367"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"96.0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"96.0"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"96","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"8.0","priorTotalTargets":"47","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"3.6","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"24"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"24"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"19"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"19"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"94","positionRank":"34","bestRank":"57","worstRank":"149","avgRank":"95.84","stdDev":"16.97","adp":"76","vsAdp":"-18","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/quvoqaapbnebbllg3jwl","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/quvoqaapbnebbllg3jwl","picLocation":"/images/players/LeonardFournette.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"3 days ago","text":"It's easy to recall the good times Fournette had in the playoffs and use that as a reason to move him up draft boards, but don't let a couple games spoil what was a very mediocre season.

Fournette's primary source of fantasy points in 2020 was via the passing game, as he saw 47 targets in 13 games.

We also can't forget about O.J. Howard, who had more production and targets than Gronkowski when he tore his Achilles. Gronkowski will certainly offer some streamable weeks, but relying on him as your every-week tight end would be a mistake with all the mouths they have to feed in Tampa Bay.

Henry should be in scoring position quite a bit this year knowing the Titans went out and acquired Julio Jones this offseason. There's no scenario where your offense gets worse in that equation. However, we don't know how the offense is going to look in 2021, as Arthur Smith (offensive coordinator the last two years) is gone. Still, with Jones and A.J. Brown on the perimeter, it's going to be tough for opponents to stack the box the way they have against Henry the last few years, so his efficiency may actually go up. There are certainly some variables to his projections, but Henry has proven that despite his lack of usage in the passing game, he's going to make up for it on the ground.

On top of the chemistry concern, he has to contend with youngsters Parris Campbell and Michael Pittman, who are both another year into their NFL career, and likely ready to take on bigger roles.

days ago","text":"We saw a glimpse of what Hurts can bring to the table last year, though it was just a four-game sample size. He started four games for the Eagles, and each of those games netted at least 16.3 fantasy points, highlighting a floor that's hard to find. He also flashed upside with a 37.8-point outburst in Week 15 against the Cardinals. The downside is that it was a small sample size, and Hurts appeared to get worse every time out. Even then, it's still a small sample size. There's a new coaching staff, along with a new No. 1 receiver, but if what we saw from Hurts in 2020 was his floor, we're in for a treat in 2021. If he can hone in and improve his accuracy numbers from 2020, there's legitimate top-six quarterback upside.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"BREAKOUT","text":"Hurts has a very fertile fantasy situation cultivating around him. He brings the needed toolset with his rushing ability. The team traded up to grab a true number one wide receiver DeVonta Smith. It wasn’t the prettiest nor largest of sample sizes in his few starts last year, but we at least saw proof of concept. It’s hard to know if the team really has complete faith in him or not, but at the very least they chose Jalen over Carson Wentz.

days ago","text":"Despite T.Y. Hilton aging and Parris Campbell missing the entire season, Pittman couldn't break out in his rookie season. While that might be high expectations, the opportunity was there. Philip Rivers turned out to be better than most expected, though Pittman finished with more than 66 yards just once all year, and topped 46 yards just three times. He scored just once, which surely didn't help his year-end totals, but with Campbell back in the mix, he isn't a surefire pick to gain a whole lot of targets. Hilton was re-signed, Zach Pascal out-produced him, and Carson Wentz has traditionally favored his targets over the middle of the field. Pittman should lead this team in touchdowns with his large frame, but he's likely to be a bit too touchdown-dependent to trust as anything more than a boom-or-bust WR4.

What happens here is direct contusion or trauma to the lower leg can cause swelling, which leads to pressure on the nerves and arteries in the leg.

That said, Julio is now 32 years old, and research suggests that re-injury risk for hamstring, quad and calf strains increases 1.3x per year.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"18706":{"fantasyProsId":"18706","tier":10,"playerName":"Darius Slayton","position":"WIDERECEIVER","bye":"10","team":"GIANTS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-272,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-40","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"C","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":16,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"50"},{"name":"YDS","value":"751"},{"name":"TDS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"50"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"3"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"751"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"2"},{"name":"YDS","value":"-1"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"2"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"-1"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"90.99999999999997"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"90.99999999999997"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"91","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"5.7","priorTotalTargets":"96","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"6.0","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"22"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"22"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"188","positionRank":"71","bestRank":"122","worstRank":"343","avgRank":"193.92","stdDev":"31.71","adp":"272","vsAdp":"84","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/bhwntjsadzhazxe1arqh","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/bhwntjsadzhazxe1arqh","picLocation":"/images/players/DariusSlayton.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"3 days ago","text":"While 2019 seemed like Slayton might have a bright future in the NFL, 2020 wasn't as kind to him.

On top of that, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski returned to game shape, which will certainly cap everyone's upside.

How many targets per game do you anticipate Beckham getting this year? I'm going with an extremely low number and say he averages 6.5 targets per game. That sounds more than reasonable, right? Beckham had 7.0 targets per game during the 2020 season before getting hurt and that includes a three-target game against the Steelers. The Browns were also throwing the ball a lot less early in the year as Baker Mayfield was still getting grasp on Kevin Stefanski's playbook. If Beckham gets 6.5 targets per game, that'd put him on pace for 104 targets, which again, is what I'd consider low. There were just 32 receivers in the NFL who hit that number last year, with 24 of them (75 percent) finishing as top-24 receivers and just two finishing worse than WR38. You mean to tell me with Beckham's talent, he can't produce top-24 numbers? There's health risks for sure, but there's also top-five wide receiver upside.

He’ll be 29 in November, which is important given that there is a statistically significant difference in the rate of soft tissue injuries in players that are age 26 and younger and we know from research studies that younger NFL players tend to have better performance outcomes following ACL surgery.

Henry should be in scoring position quite a bit this year knowing the Titans went out and acquired Julio Jones this offseason. There's no scenario where your offense gets worse in that equation. However, we don't know how the offense is going to look in 2021, as Arthur Smith (offensive coordinator the last two years) is gone. Still, with Jones and A.J.

The difference? Stafford hasn't had a play-caller to bring out the best in him for quite some time and it's crushed his fantasy upside. Welcome to L.A. where you'll be working with Sean McVay, whose offense has been handicapped with Jared Goff under center. Could this be the change Stafford needed to reach the next level? The only concern would be that the Rams defense is so good, we won't get the volume needed for a pocket passer like Stafford.

Gibson was able to avoid surgery and return to play just last year just three weeks after injury (albeit at less than 100%). Typical return to play for a grade III (complete tear of the ligaments) injury ranges from 8-12 weeks if treated nonoperatively, and we already know Gibson was able to avoid surgery, suggesting this is not as significant as an injury as the one sustained by Patrick Mahomes. Unless Gibson suffered a setback in rehab (which has not yet been reported), I remain optimistic about Gibson’s health entering 2021, especially given that he is participating in OTA’s in June, sprinting and cutting.

While I don't expect him to get there, he's one of just two running backs (Christian McCaffrey is the other) who I'm projecting for 100-plus targets in 2021. Targets are worth twice as much as carries, so even if Ekeler winds up getting just 12 carries per game, it's not the end of the world. In fact, he can still finish as a borderline RB1 if he were to hit just 200 carries on the season. The new coaching staff obviously brings on some potential volatility, but there's not much other talent on the roster at running back, so his role should be very safe.

He averaged 4.46 yards per carry, 5.73 yards per target, and scored 10 total touchdowns, which is solid, though nothing special. Enter Urban Meyer, who said they wanted to add depth/competition at the running back position. After adding Carlos Hyde, you knew Robinson would lose some touches, but it wasn't that much of a concern. After drafting Travis Etienne in the first round, it's definitely a concern. Robinson would be lucky to earn a 50/40/10 split with Etienne and Hyde, with Robinson being the 40 of the group.

Now going to the Giants, who have a bevy of options, including Sterling Shepard, Kadarius Toney, Darius Slayton, Evan Engram, Kyle Rudolph, and Saquon Barkley is going to be tough. To be fair, you don't go out in free agency and sign someone like Golladay to give him five targets per game, but he's not going to get the consistent targets he got in Detroit, and the targets he does get aren't going to be as efficient coming from Daniel Jones.

I'd rather take shots on the rookie quarterbacks who might not start out of the gate, as Carr certainly wouldn't be your QB1.

signed a one-year $6 million deal to fly north to division rival Seattle.

He's easily the most talented TE to work with Russell Wilson since Jimmy Graham and could be in a position to steal some red-zone looks from D.K. Metcalf.

There's no two ways about it. To be handed the starting job just one hour before the game in Week 2, then go on to break the rookie record for passing touchdowns (31) is ridiculous. Now, with that being said, he still finished as the QB9 last year while throwing 595 pass attempts, the fourth most in the legaue. Now that he's got a defensive-minded head coach and a healthy defense, we could see the pass attempts dip a bit in 2021, which would certainly hurt his appeal. The Chargers did increase the talent on the offensive line, but also replaced Hunter Henry with Jared Cook, which is a certainly a downgrade. Herbert should still be a solid low-end QB1, but it's tough to see him finishing as a top-five option in 2021.

days ago","text":"Despite being an freakish athlete, Fant was an incredibly boring fantasy asset to roster in 2020, finishing with 35-57 yards in 9-of-15 games, while failing to top 81 yards in any one game. The issue stems from his quarterback, as the targets are simply not that valuable, because 93 of them (what Fant saw) is more than enough to be a reliable fantasy asset. Unfortunately, we don't know if Drew Lock will still be the quarterback, and the Broncos have Courtland Sutton returning to the lineup, which will surely cut into Fant's target share. On top of that, the team seemed to like using both Fant and Albert Okwuegbunam prior to Okwuegbunam's injury last year, which is another ding on Fant's fantasy stock. He's fine, but unless there's a change at quarterback, he's nothing you can't live without.

He’s still gifted athletically, averaging over 12 yards per reception in his first two years. If this Denver passing offense somehow is redirected through Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater, Fant could be a major beneficiary and a weekly startable TE, which doesn’t grow on trees folks!

The issue, however, is that he's being reunited with offensive coordinator Scott Turner, who couldn't get the most out of Samuel during the 2019 season. While Samuel saw a career-high 106 targets that year, he averaged a minuscule 5.9 yards per target while used in an incorrect role. Will that change? It's tough to say, but Terry McLaurin, J.D. McKissic, Antonio Gibson, and Logan Thomas are all competition for targets with his new team. Samuel should have plenty of manufactured touches, but don't automatically assume he's as valuable as he was in 2020.

Part of his issues were drops, but Ben Roethlisberger's drop-down mentality certainly didn't help, either. Still, chasing targets at wide receiver is never a bad thing. If Johnson would've averaged just 7.4 yards per target (easily attainable), he would've finished as the WR14.

He posted WR3 or better type numbers in just 50 percent of the games last year, which was tied with Jamison Crowder and DeVante Parker for 34th among wide receivers. His four-touchdown game in Week 5 really catapulted his numbers at season's end, as he failed to top 59 yards in 11-of-16 games, making him a touchdown-or-bust option most weeks. With Ben Roethlisberger's arm strength seemingly deteriorating by the day, it's tough to see Claypool having a true breakout season in 2021, as he relies on those high value targets more than JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson do. Claypool is an upside pick for sure, but not one I'd bet heavily on.

While operating as Le'Veon Bell's backup, Conner had pep in his step and performed like an RB1 when given the opportunity. But once he took over as the team's No. 1 running back, injuries continually piled up, letting his body know he wasn't capable of being that guy. Many are assuming that Chase Edmonds is the No. 1 running back in this offense, and while I believe that's the case, there's a non-zero percent chance that Conner takes over the Kenyan Drake role from last season that netted 239 carries and 31 targets. There's a reason the Cardinals signed him in free agency, so he will have a role, but the question is \"how big?\" He might be worth a late-round pick just in case he does get the Drake role (or even 80 percent of it).

It's because they used him in the possession-style role with a shorter average depth of target than he was getting with the Jets. The Panthers lost Curtis Samuel in free agency, but gained Terrace Marshall in the draft, and will get Christian McCaffrey back from injury, so the loss of Samuel doesn't do a whole lot for projections. D.J. Moore started coming on more as the year went on, though the switch to Sam Darnold could prove to be a good thing for Anderson, who was Darnold's teammate with the Jets. It's still the same offense, and Anderson proved he's able to contribute in a big way, making him somewhat of a safe WR3/4 option with WR2 upside should Darnold favor him as the top option.

He finished as an RB2 or better in just 56.3 percent of games in PPR formats, which was slightly behind Miles Sanders and slightly ahead of Ronald Jones. His value was arguably better with Chubb on the field last year, so maybe it's a matter of keeping him fresh?

It's the same reason D'Andre Swift is falling into middling RB2 range of drafts - it's not because of his talent. Even if Swift were to miss time, the Lions would likely bring in another running back to share the workload. They already brought Todd Gurley in for a visit, so they clearly haven't taken their minds off adding another running back.

Even so, he still finished as th No. 10 quarterback in fantasy, and he should continue to be a reliable option. If Seattle can manage to attempt more field-goal attempts than the 26 they have averaged over the last two seasons, Myers could be an elite option.

days ago","text":"Though it was better than his 2019 season, there were plenty of ups and downs from Smith-Schuster in 2020. Part of the reason for inconsistency is due to Ben Roethlisberger's volatile performance, but even if he rights the ship in 2021, the bigger part of the problem for Smith-Schuster is the competition he has for targets. Chase Claypool will be entering his sophomore season, Diontae Johnson seemed to figure out his drops as the year went on, and they added Najee Harris and Pat Freiermuth in the first two rounds of the draft. Suddenly, Smith-Schuster might be third in line for targets in this offense. He'll probably finish as a WR3, but I just don't see the upside to drafting him as anything more than a low-end WR3.
