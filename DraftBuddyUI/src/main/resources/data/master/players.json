Those two running backs were Derrick Henry and Nick Chubb, who averaged 5.4 and 5.6 yards per carry, numbers no one can actually project to hit. They also scored 17 and 12 touchdowns on the ground, propping their numbers up. Dobbins saw just 24 targets last year, a number that's unlikely to move much considering he's in the same offense with the same quarterback, only with more weapons around him. If Dobbins can rush for over 5.0 yards per carry (he did last year) and score double-digit rushing touchdowns (again, hard to project), he's going to finish as a top-10 running back, but not top-five due to the lack of work in the passing game. He's best-suited as your RB2 who has RB1 in his range of outcomes.

This highlights the fact that they still value Graham with his $10 million salary. With Graham still around, it's going to be tough for Kmet to become an every-week starter. Things can change quickly, but for now, Kmet is just a streaming option.

He tallied 26-plus fantasy points in eight games last year, which tied for the most in the league. Even better is that he had just one game that was labeled a bust, which lets you know he's a set-it-and-forget-it quarterback who can be played, regardless of opponent. When spending a high-round pick on a quarterback, that's what you need. Allen can start to be considered around the fourth round.

How many targets per game do you anticipate Beckham getting this year? I'm going with an extremely low number and say he averages 6.5 targets per game. That sounds more than reasonable, right? Beckham had 7.0 targets per game during the 2020 season before getting hurt and that includes a three-target game against the Steelers. The Browns were also throwing the ball a lot less early in the year as Baker Mayfield was still getting grasp on Kevin Stefanski's playbook. If Beckham gets 6.5 targets per game, that'd put him on pace for 104 targets, which again, is what I'd consider low. There were just 32 receivers in the NFL who hit that number last year, with 24 of them (75 percent) finishing as top-24 receivers and just two finishing worse than WR38. You mean to tell me with Beckham's talent, he can't produce top-24 numbers? There's health risks for sure, but there's also top-five wide receiver upside.

A report originally surfaced in late January that Thomas may require surgery on his ankle, and it looks like he attempted to rehab and delay surgery as long as possible to see if he could recover without surgery. However, at this point, Thomas is going to miss regular season games and is a strong candidate to begin the year on the PUP list. The final thing to consider here is that Thomas will also require time to acclimate back into football, so it’s unlikely Thomas is 100% in his first couple of games once he does return to the field.

It's not to say timeshare backs can't get into the top-12 conversation - they can, but it requires a lot of scoring opportunities, something we're not expecting from the Lions offense.

helped him achieve those numbers. The major ones being the injuries to George Kittle and Deebo Samuel. There were just four games where the trio were on the field together, and during that time, Aiyuk saw just 21 targets (the lowest of the three) and had 13/189/1 combined in those games. To be fair, it was from Week 4-7, so it was very early in Aiyuk's rookie season, so it's possible he just hadn't earned the trust yet. There's a wide range of outcomes in his projections, going as high as a top-15 wide receiver, but also as low as a wide receiver in the WR30-36 range. You want equity when drafting, so taking Aiyuk as anything more than a WR3 when Kittle and Samuel are healthy is risky.

The Panthers traded him for essentially nothing, and then passed on Justin Fields and Mac Jones in the draft, so they clearly believe Darnold can be their long-term answer. I don't want to hold it against Darnold that he had to play for Adam Gase in two of his first three seasons, but at the same time, he's thrown more than two touchdowns in just three of his 38 career games to this point and offers minimal fantasy upside on the ground.

He led the league in field-goal attempts with 41, and was accurate within 50 yards, missing just a single kick. But he simply couldn't hit from long range, going just 3-for-9 from 50-plus yards.

Then we saw Giovani Bernard get knocked out of the lineup for a few weeks, and it led to Mixon totaling 27.0 touches per game over the next three weeks before getting hurt. Now that Bernard is gone, are we finally going to get a full season's worth of 20-plus touch games for Mixon? If so, top-five is in the realm of possibilities, especially knowing he'll be more involved in the passing game.

However, if you think he's a breakout candidate to finish as a top-five running back, you're betting against the odds. Among the running backs who finished top-10 last year, just two of them finished there while seeing fewer than 39 targets. Those two running backs were Derrick Henry and Nick Chubb, who averaged 5.4 and 5.6 yards per carry, numbers no one can actually project to hit. They also scored 17 and 12 touchdowns on the ground, propping their numbers up. Dobbins saw just 24 targets last year, a number that's unlikely to move much considering he's in the same offense with the same quarterback, only with more weapons around him. If Dobbins can rush for over 5.0 yards per carry (he did last year) and score double-digit rushing touchdowns (again, hard to project), he's going to finish as a top-10 running back, but not top-five due to the lack of work in the passing game. He's best-suited as your RB2 who has RB1 in his range of outcomes.

That is a ridiculously high TD rate and causes you to question: did he show double-digit TD ability or is there regression coming?

They traded up to draft Trey Sermon in the third round, which could indicate they're ready to move on from Mostert, or it could be them ensuring they have a high-quality backup for if/when he gets injured.

fall even further.

The big question is: Who is his quarterback once he returns? If it's Hill, there should be a slight downgrade, but don't forget what Thomas did in the four Hill games last year: 9/104/0, 4/50/0, 9/105/0, and 8/84/0.

This all stems from Thomas’ left high ankle sprain from Week 1 of 2020, which forced Thomas to be shut down at the end of the season. A report originally surfaced in late January that Thomas may require surgery on his ankle, and it looks like he attempted to rehab and delay surgery as long as possible to see if he could recover without surgery. However, at this point, Thomas is going to miss regular season games and is a strong candidate to begin the year on the PUP list. The final thing to consider here is that Thomas will also require time to acclimate back into football, so it’s unlikely Thomas is 100% in his first couple of games once he does return to the field.

He also paced the league in pass attempts with 626 but managed only 26 passing TDs, which has been his bugaboo in his career. The early offseason sentiment is that the Falcons were ready to move on but their moves recently have dictated they're ready to roll with him for at least another two years. He can easily finish inside the top-8 with new head coach Arthur Smith but you won’t have to draft him there. Expect more play-action passes and perhaps we'll see a flood of TDs. While Calvin Ridley has reached star status, Matt Ryan has struggled in the past without Julio on the field.","dynastyBlurb":"The Falcons and owner Arthur Blank showed continued confidence in Ryan keeping him on the team while passing on young QBs in the draft.

The only concern would be that the Rams defense is so good, we won't get the volume needed for a pocket passer like Stafford.

As someone who relies on volume to produce, McKissic is more of a passing-down handcuff to Gibson.

Gibson was able to avoid surgery and return to play just last year just three weeks after injury (albeit at less than 100%). Typical return to play for a grade III (complete tear of the ligaments) injury ranges from 8-12 weeks if treated nonoperatively, and we already know Gibson was able to avoid surgery, suggesting this is not as significant as an injury as the one sustained by Patrick Mahomes. Unless Gibson suffered a setback in rehab (which has not yet been reported), I remain optimistic about Gibson’s health entering 2021, especially given that he is participating in OTA’s in June, sprinting and cutting.

I bring this up because on August 3, Golladay left Giants practice early, grabbing the back of his left thigh, which is usually the tell-tale sign of a hamstring strain.

He’ll turn 27 years old this year and if we’ve seen any sort of historical indicator as of late, it’s that free agent RBs don’t end up finishing out their contract extensions. You can likely bank on at least two more years of top-end production barring an injury and A.J. Dillon’s thighs taking over. But if your league mates value Jones as a top-5 RB right now given the explosion of fantasy points we’ve seen from him over the last two years, be willing to trade for a haul."}},"16431":{"fantasyProsId":"16431","tier":15,"playerName":"Zay

The issue stems from his quarterback, as the targets are simply not that valuable, because 93 of them (what Fant saw) is more than enough to be a reliable fantasy asset. Unfortunately, we don't know if Drew Lock will still be the quarterback, and the Broncos have Courtland Sutton returning to the lineup, which will surely cut into Fant's target share. On top of that, the team seemed to like using both Fant and Albert Okwuegbunam prior to Okwuegbunam's injury last year, which is another ding on Fant's fantasy stock. He's fine, but unless there's a change at quarterback, he's nothing you can't live without.

week ago","text":"It was good to see Samuel finally have his breakout season in year four, though it's worth noting that his numbers have improved every year. The issue, however, is that he's being reunited with offensive coordinator Scott Turner, who couldn't get the most out of Samuel during the 2019 season. While Samuel saw a career-high 106 targets that year, he averaged a minuscule 5.9 yards per target while used in an incorrect role. Will that change? It's tough to say, but Terry McLaurin, J.D. McKissic, Antonio Gibson, and Logan Thomas are all competition for targets with his new team. Samuel should have plenty of manufactured touches, but don't automatically assume he's as valuable as he was in 2020.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Samuel missed all of Washington’s June mini-camp with a groin issue, and it appears he is still battling the same injury now in training camp after landing on the PUP list. Reports out of Washington indicate that the team is not concerned about their WR’s injury, but it is worth noting that this injury has been an issue dating back to OTAs in late May. Assuming this is a groin strain, his recovery timeline suggests this is a moderate strain. These injuries can be tricky, as they’re stressed with dynamic lateral movements, which are crucial for wide receivers coming in and out of their breaks. Washington may be conservative with Samuel in the preseason as an aggravation of this injury over the next few weeks could possibly lead to concerns regarding his Week 1 availability. This is an injury to monitor leading up to fantasy drafts.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"18928","position":"WIDERECEIVER","overallPoints":203,"avgPoints":11.9,"positionRank":39,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":120,"rushingTouchdowns":1,"receptions":70,"receivingYards":917,"receivingTouchdowns":4,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":0,"risk":5,"name":"Curtis Samuel","blurb":"Reunited with OC Scott Turner and head coach Ron Rivera, Samuel is very familiar with this system.

While operating as Le'Veon Bell's backup, Conner had pep in his step and performed like an RB1 when given the opportunity. But once he took over as the team's No. 1 running back, injuries continually piled up, letting his body know he wasn't capable of being that guy. Many are assuming that Chase Edmonds is the No. 1 running back in this offense, and while I believe that's the case, there's a non-zero percent chance that Conner takes over the Kenyan Drake role from last season that netted 239 carries and 31 targets. There's a reason the Cardinals signed him in free agency, so he will have a role, but the question is \"how big?\" He might be worth a late-round pick just in case he does get the Drake role (or even 80 percent of it).

Part of the reason for inconsistency is due to Ben Roethlisberger's volatile performance, but even if he rights the ship in 2021, the bigger part of the problem for Smith-Schuster is the competition he has for targets. Chase Claypool will be entering his sophomore season, Diontae Johnson seemed to figure out his drops as the year went on, and they added Najee Harris and Pat Freiermuth in the first two rounds of the draft. Suddenly, Smith-Schuster might be third in line for targets in this offense. He'll probably finish as a WR3, but I just don't see the upside to drafting him as anything more than a low-end WR3.
