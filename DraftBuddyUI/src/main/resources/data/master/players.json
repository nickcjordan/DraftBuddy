He was a full-blown bellcow for the Raiders leading the NFL in touches through 17 weeks. The 24-year-old will have to play on the franchise tag after leading the NFL with 1,653 rushing yards. With a similar cast of characters returning as depth behind him, it's hard to envision the Raiders not heavily leaning on him again as a true featured back. But there's a lot of risk involved considering Jacobs is threatening to hold out into the regular season. He is not going to report to training camp. Furthermore, only 2 RBs finished as RB1s the following year after leading the NFL in touches since 2013.

From Week 9 on, Jacobs was the RB1, which doesn’t include two RB1 finishes from earlier in the year. After the Raiders franchised him this off-season, he returns as a strong top-10 RB candidate yet again...if he decides to play Week 1. Fantasy drafters need to be monitoring the news closely.

days ago","text":"Drafters were expecting A.J. Dillon to carve out a formidable role in the Packers backfield in 2022, but he was a complete afterthough for the majority of the season. His highly-touted \"red-zone role\" resulted in one touchdown (Week 1) in the first 11 weeks in a struggling Green Bay offense. Dillon eventually got more involved in the second half of the season, especially as a red-zone threat. From Week 9 onward, Dillon out-carried teammate Aaron Jones inside the 10-yard line 14 to 5 while splitting snaps exactly 50/50. And they scored the same amount of points total from Week 11 through Week 17, with Dillion scoring six rushing TDs. If Dillon's goal-line usage carries over from the tail-end of the 2022 season, that would significantly hinder Jones' fantasy upside while stabilizing Dillon's fantasy value. The bruising running back finished fifth in PFF rushing grade last season and will hit free agency at the end of the 2023 season. He also flashed top-tier handcuff upside when Jones got banged up versus the Bears in Week 13. Dillon tied a season-high with 18 carries for 93 yards and one touchdown to go along with three catches for 26 yards.

Dillon is better suited for the hired muscle role than a featured final boss. The Packers never quite felt comfortable turning over the backfield to Dillon, restructuring Aaron Jones’ contract.  The Green Bay offense fell completely flat in 2022 as the offense scored 13 fewer TDs than the year before. After scoring in Week 1, Dillon failed to visit the end zone again until Week 12. The goal-line duties will likely continue to be split between the two backs, but Jordan Love brings a level of uncertainty to the overall offense outlook.

ETN would proceed to finish the 2022 fantasy regular season tied for 5th in carries inside the 10-yard line (23), but he only scored four touchdowns on those carries. He's primed to see his TD numbers climb with the backfield all but his from the get-go in 2023 in ascending offense. Etienne also just scratched the surface of how he can contribute in the passing game. The receiving \"role\" has been his in terms of routes run most weeks in 2022, but targets did not always follow with Trevor Lawrence preferring Christian Kirk, Zay Jones and Evan Engram - who all stayed healthy in 2022. If one of those guys goes down in 2023 we will probably see ETN see a boosted receiving role. The second-year rusher averaged a 22% target rate per route in 3 of his last four games played. No. 2 running back/pass-catcher JaMycal Hasty, former Cleveland Brown D'Ernest Johnson and 2023 third-rounder Tank Bigsby are behind him on the current depth chart.

While the Jaguars offense took a major step forward in 2022, it’s a bit strange why they don’t involve him more in the passing game. Only 14% of Trevor Lawrence’s targets went to RBs (2nd lowest mark in the NFL) and Etienne was targeted in only 12.7 % of his routes, 2nd worst among RBs.

days ago","text":"Khalil Herbert was better than David Montgomery in nearly every single rushing metric in 2022. He averaged 5.7 yards per carry to Montgomery's flat 4.0 yards per carry average. Herbert rushed for just 70 fewer yards on 72 fewer carries. Monty's rushing EPA of -15.3 ranked 32nd while Herbert's 1.17 rushing EPA ranked 12th. Had Herbert not gotten hurt in Week 10 versus the Detroit Lions, there was a non-zero chance he would have completely usurped Montgomery as the team's lead back. \n\nIn the two games that Herbert led the backfield due to a Montgomery injury, the Bears second-year rusher averaged 117 rushing yards and 19.5 carries. Herbert also has just had as many career games (4) as Montgomery with at least 90 rushing yards.\n\nWith Monty leaving in free agency, the rebuilding Bears let him walk and added D'Onta Foreman to join the backfield. Foreman's flashes of high-end early-down starting potential for two straight seasons are going to earn him opportunities in Chicago. Even though Herbert has shown out on limited opportunities, it's hard to envision anything but another usage split between Herbert and Foreman similar to the split between Herbert and Montgomery last season.\n\nForeman and Herbert earned nearly identical rushing EPA per attempt last year (inside the top 15). Fantasy managers might be best off taking the cheaper of the two in drafts because there may not be a true No. 1 rusher in the Windy City unless there's an injury. If the Bears are as run-heavy as they were last season, there's a chance that both can return value, but keep in mind that Justin Fields' own rushing will take away volume chances from both backs.\n\nFantasy managers also have to consider 4th-round rookie draft selection, Roschon Johnson. Johnson's efficient rushing style, bell-cow size and pass-protection props figure to complicate the Bears backfield into a potential three-headed monster.

He ranked 5th among RBs in yards per carry (5.7) and 9th in yards created per touch (3.29) making him an intriguing RB2 in a run-first offense led by Justin Fields. However, the team might not be as committed to him, bringing in bruiser D’Onta Foreman and 4th round pick Roschon Johnson to help carry the load.

The dominoes might not be done falling, though, as this could also signal a Renfrow departure. Renfrow can be cut, and the Raiders can save 1.5 million against the cap. The likeliest outcome is that Renfrow remains in Vegas this year and is cut bait next year when the team can save 8.2 million against the cap next year by kicking him to the curb.

Meyers played 69.5% from the slot last year (Renfrow 86.0%), drawing a 22.0% target share (29th), a 25.8% target per route run rate (22nd), and a 27.4% air yard share as the Patriots' number one option. He was 29th in PFF receiving grade and 23rd in yards per route run (minimum 50 targets per PFF). Meyers has been the WR29 and WR35 in fantasy points per game over the last two seasons. Meyers' signing could signal the Raiders' plan to deploy more 11 personnel this season after ranking 18th in the use of three-plus wide receiver sets last year.

days ago","text":"The Buffalo Bills signed Damien Harris (RB42 ADP) to a one-year contract to fill the void left by Devin Singletary. Bills general manager Brandon Beane stated earlier this offseason that the team wanted to add another back with more \"size\" to compliment smaller running backs like James Cook and Nyheim Hines. Harris, at 216 pounds, fits the mold of the bigger back that Beane was after, so it's not a shock to see this deal completed.\n\nLast season, the former Patriots running back was plagued by injuries, playing in just 11 contests - two of which he left early. And in his nine healthy games, Harris averaged just 8.8 fantasy points, 11 carries, and 49 rushing yards per game. He took a major backseat to the surging Rhamondre Stevenson, who operated as the RB1 in the backfield for the majority of the season.\n\nNow with Buffalo, Harris' best fantasy prospects are for him to land the Bills' red-zone back role. He scored just as many times as Stevenson from inside the ten-yard line last season (thrice) despite being out-carried in that area of the field 19 to six. \n\nIn 2022, former Bills RB Devin Singletary totaled just four rushing TDs inside the 10-yard on 16 carries. QB Josh Allen is frequently deployed as a goal-line rusher which might limit Harris' touchdown totals in 2023. However, we have seen quarterbacks run less at the goal line as they get older, so there's still a chance that Harris flirts with double-digit scores should his arrival mean the team leans on him more as their preferred rusher near the pylon to protect their franchise quarterback in the long term.

He was solid over the first month, averaging 15+ touches per game before dealing with hamstring and thigh injuries and giving way to Rhamondre Stevenson to lead the Patriots the rest of the way. Harris stays in the AFC East in a rather enigmatic backfield for fantasy purposes. Since 2018, Bills RBs have ranked 26th, 23rd, 30th, 30th, and 31st in fantasy points scored correlating with Josh Allen’s arrival in Buffalo.

Moore still managed to rank 27th in PFF receiving grade and 32nd in yards per route run (minimum 50 targets per PFF). We witnessed his floor last season as Moore was 12th in target share (27.7%), 17th in target per route run rate (26.8%), and fourth in deep targets. Justin Fields will be the best passer that Moore has worked with to this point. While the target volume concerns are justified for Moore in Chicago's offense, he has already displayed the ability to earn targets at a high rate. If the Bears' passing volume surprises with the receiving upgrades this offseason, Moore will happily pay off his ADP.

days ago","text":"DeAndre Hopkins missed the first six games of the season due to suspension and the final two weeks with a knee sprain, but when he was on the field, he proved he hadn't hit the age cliff yet. Hopkins was the WR9 in fantasy points per game last season, drawing a 29.4% target share (fourth-best) and 43.5% air-yard share (second-best). Hopkins can still draw volume with the best of them, but his efficiency did tick down a bit as he was 17th in yards per route run and 35th in open rate (tied with Christian Kirk, per ESPN analytics).

days ago","text":"David Montgomery signed a 3-year deal worth $18 million ($11 million guaranteed) with the Detroit Lions this offseason, setting him up to be the new Jamaal Williams on the field for the foreseeable future. In Montgomery's 15 healthy games played last season, he averaged 10.9 fantasy points per game as the RB26. But in 11 games, he played alongside a healthy Khalil Herbert, Montgomery saw an even bigger decline in production averaging just 9.2 fantasy points (RB35), 13 carries, and 48 rushing yards per game. Monty's rushing EPA of -15.3 ranked 32nd, while Herbert's 1.17 rushing EPA ranked 12th.\nAnd with the new addition of 12th overall draft pick, Jahmyr Gibbs, it's hard to envision Montgomery as anything more than a fantasy RB2/RB3 with the highly coveted goal-line role likely his main path to appealing fantasy production. Keep in mind that last season, Jamaal Williams carried the ball a league-high 45 times inside the 10-yard line en route to an RB12 fantasy finish and a league-high 17 rushing TDs; not too far off his 16.4 expected touchdowns. \n\nA similar red-zone role will lead to more scoring for Montgomery which will supplement solid fantasy production at a relatively cheap price tag. Williams' role from 2022 - 262 carries (6th), 16.1 touches per game - and Montgomery's contract suggests the team will be featuring enough (likely as a rusher on early downs) to be fantasy viable alongside Gibbs.

Things were looking up and then the Lions went gaga over Jahmyr Gibbs in the NFL Draft. While Montgomery certainly could replace the coveted Jamaal Williams goal-line, the Lions ran especially hot inside the red-zone last year.

The Lions running back came out of the gates red hot, but got hurt. And when he returned, the Lions refused to give him the featured role in the backfield, opting to use Jamaal Williams as their goal-line battering ram instead. \nSwift was still uber-efficient on a per-touch basis - fourth in fantasy points per touch, third in yards per carry, 23rd in points per game and 19th in yards after contact per attempt - but the lack of touchdowns and overall touches was soul-crushing. Swift seemed to never be 100% healthy at any point during the year, which likely influenced his reduced role. And Detroit's lack of willingness to get Swift involved was a sign of things to come as they would eventually trade him to the Philadelphia Eagles for a future Day 3 pick. \n\nWith a full bill of health heading into 2023, Swift will again be productive on a per-touch basis in his new offense. But be warned that his injury history and draft capital spent on Swift guarantees him nothing under a new coaching staff in Philadelphia. Fantasy managers should also be aware that Swift and fellow newcomer Rashaad Penny are both solid rushers, posting identical success rates last season. \n\nSwift also won't be used as often in the passing game, after the Eagles finished dead last in RB target share last season (12.1%) and total RB targets.

Traded to Philadelphia this off-season, Swift enters the final year of his rookie deal with something to prove teamed up with arguably the league’s best rushing attack. The Eagles backfield ranked #1 in expected points per rush attempt in 2022 thanks in large part to the near-impossible-to-stop goal-line “tush push” of Jalen Hurts. Swift still profiles as one of the league’s best pass-catchers, but the Eagles might use more of a committee approach than fantasy managers might like.

days ago","text":"2023 was a year to forget for the consensus 1.01 in last year's fantasy football drafts. Jonathan Taylor underperformed as the RB30 in 11 games played, averaging 12.6 fantasy points as the RB18 when healthy. JT's usage was that of a top-8 running back - 8th in expected points per game, 4th in touches per game (20) - but a lack of touchdowns decimated his fantasy stock in the Colts' anemic offense. After scoring a combined 33 TDs through his 1st two seasons, Taylor scored just four rushing TDs in 2022.\nFrom an efficiency standpoint, I'd expect a bounce-back effort from Taylor in 2023. He will be healthier in 2023, and rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson's mobility under center should increase JT's rushing efficiency. When Taylor first returned from injury (Weeks 10-13 in the 2022 season), he ranked as the RB3 overall. And he should experience some positive TD regression entering the final year of his rookie deal. However, it should be noted that with Richardson under center, Taylor won't cannibalize all the goal-line carries.\nHowever, a mobile quarterback didn't stop Shane Steichen's running back, Miles Sanders, from scoring 13 TDs in 2022. Considering the wide talent gap and proven production from Taylor compared to Sanders, I'd bet Steichen's new RB1 will reach double-digit scores even if his rookie QB runs in a few himself.\nBut that's under the presumption that the JT remains a Colt in 2023. The All-Pro running back has demanded a trade from Indianapolis after the team failed to give him a new contract with him hitting free agency at the end of the year. He's currently on the PUP list - recovering from January ankle surgery - but the team has talked about putting him on the NFI list. This stems from a report that he suffered a back injury away from the facility, but Taylor has denied he has ever suffered a back injury. Again, it's clear that Taylor is disgruntled and that these two parties are going to part sooner rather than later. Jim Irsay has claimed they won't trade him now and they won't trade him in October. The Panthers GM said the same thing last offseason about Christian McCaffrey, who got traded after the team started 1-5. So, I think there's a pretty good chance Taylor gets dealt away at some point, whether that be in the offseason or before the trade deadline. And most likely, it would be to a contender in a favorable situation. \nAs for JT as a Colt, it's ambiguous if he's going to hold out; he's yet to play during training camp but is present in a potential effort to avoid hold-out fines. Even so, the new CBA is designed to keep players from holding out, because they do not accrue a season by sitting out. Therefore, Taylor would be just hurting himself more by not playing, because he would not be able to hit FA with accruing the final year of his rookie contract. \nAnd has an impending free agent, Indy as all the incentive in the world to \"churn and burn\" their star RB, which will likely benefit Taylor's short-term production. The downside to this is that should JT get hurt or banged up, he'd likely do whatever possible to not actually suit up. However, Taylor did say back in April that he made a four-year obligation to the Colts when he signed his rookie contract and he would essentially play it out, with massive undertones suggesting that he didn't expect to get extended before the 2023 season. Head coach Shane Steichen and Irsay have been vocal about Taylor's presence in the development of Anthony Richardson, further suggesting that he is in their short-term plans for the season. Throwing your rookie QB to the wolves without the team's best offensive player is not a recipe for success in any manner. \nCurrently behind Taylor on the Colts depth chart includes former Buffalo Bills RB Zack Moss, 2023 rookie Evan Hull and third-year RB Deon Jackson. Moss will miss the next six weeks after suffering a broken arm. \nAll in all, this is another \"buy the dip\" situation if/and Taylor's ADP nosedives into Round 3. If he plays for the Colts, he will undoubtedly be a bell cow. And if he gets traded, he will be on a contender in a better offensive situation.

With a new head coach (Shane Steichen) and new offensive play-calling philosophy, it's not a guarantee he is a Colt next year. He's young enough that the landing spot for his second NFL contract might not matter as much but it is worth exploring dealing with the young stud RB for a haul right now. Rookie QB Anthony Richardson brings some chaos into the mix, especially with his size as a goal-line rusher.

During Weeks 1-12, Chubb was the RB4 overall and in points per game. From Weeks 13-17 with Watson at quarterback, he was the RB23 overall and RB33 in points per game. These splits likely won't carry over into 2023 based on Watson likely boosting the offense's overall efficiency making Chubb a near-bust-proof draft pick based on his track record of consistency. Chubb also can capture a more prominent role as a receiver with Kareem Hunt and D'Ernest Johnson no longer on the roster. 2022 5th-rounder Jerome Ford is pegged as the No. 2 RB. In Week 18, Chubb played a season-high 75% snap share, ran a route on 71% of dropbacks and caught 5-of-6 targets (22% target share) for 45 yards.

He leads the NFL in 10+ and 15+ yard runs over the last two years and the efficiency has been with him his entire five years in the NFL.

The Giants RB finished as the RB5 overall and in points per game, as he was able to recapture his explosive upside as both a rusher and receiver. Barkley finished second in overall touches (352) and backfield opportunity share (80%) behind only Josh Jacobs through 17 weeks. He also scored 10 rushing TDs with 23 carries inside the 10-yard line. In 2021, Barkley totaled just 13 red-zone touches all season. Let Barkley's return to glory show that you want to target young impending FA RBs in improved offensive situations that project to earn high volume with proven records of production. Without a long-term contract in place - even after agreeing to a new one-year incentive-based deal worth up to $11 million - expect the Giants to run Barkley hard in 2023. They have no long commitment to him, and Barkley likely will want to maximize his financial gains from his on-field play. Per Spotrac, If Barkley earns all the incentives and earns the $11 million, his franchise tag value will increase to up to $13.2 million in 2024 or a $24.2 million payout over two years. His incentives are each $303,000 (1,350 yards rushing, 65 catches, 11 total touchdowns) and are also tied to the Giants making the playoffs based on a report from the NY Post.

The workload was insane with the 4th most carries, 6th most targets among RBs, and the 3rd most expected fantasy points at the position. He is the main engine of the New York Giants offense, but the draft cost is much higher this year.

The spurts of explosiveness and receiving ability will work in Cook's favor as he enters Year 2 with the potential to emerge as Buffalo's Day 1 starter, with Damien Harris as his main competition. \n\nThe Harris signing signifies that the second-year pro is locked-in to the elite pass-catching role vacated in the backfield. In 2022, Singletary finished third among all running backs in route participation (57%). Considering Cook's 27% target rate per route run - equal or better than Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2022, 5th among all RBs with at least 30 targets - I fully expect him to take on a much larger role as a receiver in a Bills passing attack that is shrouded with question marks behind Stefon Diggs. Nyheim Hines' season-ending injury further solidifies Cook as the No. 1 pass-catcher out of the backfield.

Efficiency-wise he was solid averaging 6.2 yards per touch, the 6th best by a rookie RB over the last decade. The biggest question is what kind of workload will this team give him with Damien Harris in the mix? He surpassed 12 touches just once on the year and only found the end-zone three times. With Josh Allen commanding a goal-line role and Damien Harris being a better short-yardage back, Cook’s fantasy success rests on his ability to catch 50+ balls and hit a couple of long TD runs.

Amid allegations of sexual assault, Watson didn't play in 2021 and served an 11-game suspension in 2022 before making a Week 13 debut for the Browns against his old team, the Texans. Watson was predictably rusty, producing numbers befitting a fantasy backup over a small sample size. It's reasonable to assume that Watson will look at least a little more like the dynamic dual-threat QB he used to be in 2023, but it would be a leap of faith to assume that he'll be as effective as he was from 2018 to 2020.

The Browns offense was noticeably worse in almost every major offensive category compared to Jacoby Brissett. For 2023, he certainly possesses some of the upside you might be looking for in a later round QB. Legal and moral issues aside, Watson is a former top-5 finisher at the position stuck in an offense that prefers to control the clock on the ground. He’s worth a look but we don’t see the same ceiling anymore.","flexRank":0,"flexGrade":0,"flexGradeBadgeClass":null,"dynastyBlurb":"Watson’s contract states he’s going to be a Brown for a long time.

McLaurin's season would have been sunk if Wentz had kept ignoring him all season. Once Wentz was sidelined by injury, McLaurin exploded with Taylor Heinicke under center.

The problem has been the quarterbacks tossing him the ball. At the moment, Washington is entertaining the Sam Howell experience under center in 2023 (it could easily be Jacoby Brissett). In Week 18, McLaurin saw a 33% target share from Howell, so if we are to take anything away from that one game sample, it's that Howell knows where his bread is buttered.

And even when Harris played alongside Stevenson, the big running back finished third in route participation (58%) and targets (82) among running backs.\nRecall that Stevenson's strong campaign en route to an RB10 finish was not fueled by touchdowns. Stevenson was one of the worst RBs converting from inside the 10-yard line as he scored just thrice despite 19 goal-line carries. His teammate Harris scored thrice from inside the 10, on just 6 carries.

In both his years at Georgia Tech, Gibbs finished second in PFF receiving grade. However, he elected to not stay at GT for his junior year and instead transferred to Alabama to be the Crimson Tide's next RB1. He led Alabama with 926 rushing yards and flashed receiving ability by catching a team-leading 44 passes for 444 receiving yards. Gibbs finished third in the FBS in receiving yards, one year removed from leading all RBs in the nation in receiving yards (470). He also flashed his explosiveness by ending the year fifth in the class in PFF's breakaway run rate (53%). \n\nAt 5-foot-9 and 199 pounds, Gibbs is on the smaller size for an every-down role. But he more than makes up for it with his receiving and speed. And the Detroit Lions hardly seem concerned about his size, considering they selected him 12th overall in the NFL Draft. The draft capital alone mitigates any workload concerns for Gibbs based on his somewhat smaller frame. Detroit paid a premium, and that means he is going to get his touches (likely high value in the form of receptions) regardless of what the team paid David Montgomery during free agency.\n\nLast season ex-Lions and newly acquired Eagles running back D'Andre Swift was uber-efficient on a per-touch basis: fourth in fantasy points per touch, third in yards per carry, 23rd in points per game and 19th in yards after contact per attempt. Swift (10.3) and Jamaal Williams (16.1) combined for 26.4 touches per game. Even with a projected 50-50 split, Gibbs is looking at a 224-touch workload. With a 55% split, Gibbs is flirting with nearly 250 total touches over a 17-game season. Simply put, the former Alabama running back needs to be ranked as back-end RB1.

This paints the picture that the blame rests upon Sutton's shoulders until we also see that he was 16th in total route wins and 12th in open rate (per ESPN analytics). Only 72.5% (71st) of his targets were catchable, and he ranked 42nd in target quality rating. With a new head wizard in Sean Payton directing this passing attack, there are reasons to buy in on a big Sutton bounceback in 2023. Sutton was 11th in deep targets and 22nd in red zone targets last year. Sutton is an upside WR3.

days ago","text":"Rashod Bateman looked like a receiver on his way to a breakout campaign before his season was derailed by a foot sprain in Week 4 and ultimately ended in Week 8 with a LisFranc injury. In Weeks 1-3, he was the WR34 in fantasy points per game with an 18.8% target share, a 30.3% air yard share, and 3.14 yards per route run. Bateman was also only a 72.7% route per dropback player in that stretch. Bateman's talent is real, but he needs his health to comply. This could be a breaking point season. The team signed Odell Beckham Jr. and drafted Zay Flowers in the first round of the NFL Draft. This will be the best collection of weapons Lamar Jackson has ever had, but that also means it's the most competition for targets Bateman has dealt with during his time in Baltimore. Bateman has the talent to still emerge as the number one receiver in this offense and compete weekly for the team lead in targets with Mark Andrews. He's a WR3/4 that could easily finish as a WR2.

Remember when Bateman was torching opposing secondaries for over 20 yards per reception and an insanely efficient 14 yards per target in Weeks 1-3? It was obviously an unsustainable pace, but it shows what sort of playmaker Bateman can be when healthy. He’s coming off the Lisfranc surgery, which does add some volatility to his 2023 outlook, and he’s got added target competition in OBJ and Zay Flowers. Overall, we like this Ravens passing attack under new OC Todd Monken, but it’s difficult to project which Baltimore pass catcher is going to emerge behind Mark Andrews. We don’t mind taking some shots on Bateman if he falls in your draft.","flexRank":97,"flexGrade":44,"flexGradeBadgeClass":"badge-graded-lighter-red","dynastyBlurb":"Bateman had a clean production profile coming out of college and 1st Round NFL Draft capital to go with it.

He has been splitting 1st-team reps with 2023 7th-round rookie selection, Kenny McIntosh. The team knows what they have in Dallas after he's spent three years within the organization. Pete Carroll has said that Dallas has bulked up to nearly 230 pounds, which gives him bell-cow size to handle a massive workload. And while McIntosh might offer more upside as a one-play receiver/explosive rusher, Dallas is built more to take on a workhorse role if presented with the opportunity. The team has never shied away from using the bigger back as part of their receiving game, as he has been targeted at least twice in half of his NFL games played where he recorded snaps on offense. The trust and reliability Dallas owns might give him the edge over McIntosh, despite the latter offering more \"sexy\" appeal as an unknown rookie. Even though Dallas owns better draft capital (4th-round versus 7th) and is a superior athlete. Remember, there's a reason that McIntosh was drafted in Round 7. He ran a 4.62 40-yard dash at 204 pounds. (23rd percentile). Dallas ran a 4.58 40-yard dash at 217 pounds. McIntosh also surpassed 15 carries just twice in his four-year collegiate career. Dallas could easily be this year's Samaje Perine. A la, a completely forgotten backup RB who finally delivers when called upon.

In his first game back, he rushed 18 times for 89 yards. He saw middling usage over the next two weeks - eight carries for 47 rushing yards per game - before getting hurt again. Mitchell's gone two straight seasons without being able to stay healthy - definitely a downside factor to being undersized running back in the Kyle Shanahan run scheme. But his efficient play at least solidified him as the primary handcuff to McCaffrey in 2023. He might see occasional spike weeks of production even while CMC is healthy (as he did at times in 2022) but I'd hardly project him for any consistent role as the No. 2 running back on the depth chart.

The team was pressed up versus the salary cap (31st in available salary cap space) and they took the out in Fournette's contract by releasing him. With Fournette out, Rachaad White would become the entrenched starter entering the season. White saw his role grow during the second half of the season, forcing a timeshare with Fournette. From Weeks 10-17, White operated as the 1A in the Buccaneers' backfield averaging 11 fantasy points per game (RB26) versus Fournette's 11.3 (RB23). White wasn't great as a rusher - four yards per carry, 66.4 PFF rushing grade - but no running back was particularly efficient behind Tampa's patchwork offensive line. The first-year rusher was better than the 28-year-old on the ground, as the veteran finished third-to-last in rushing EPA (-39.13) and 6th-worst in PFF rushing grade (67.6). Lombardi Lenny posted his worst efficiency marks since joining the Bucs in 2022, ranking 4th-worst in NFL next-gen stats rushing yards over expectation per attempt (-0.36). There was also no better display of the Bucs' hierarchy in their backfield than White edging out Fournette on the field than in the first round of the NFL playoffs. Fournette carried the ball just five times for 11 yards while White started and rushed for 41 yards on 7 carries, adding 4-of-6 targets for 36 yards (56% snap share). Fournette's disappointing campaign - outside all the dump-off receptions/targets - has definitely hurt his interest in the FA market.

Moore didn't log a single game in the regular season with 50% or higher snaps. While consensus would love the label Moore as a terrible player, that isn't true. Last year among 115 wide receivers with at least 30 targets (per PFF), Moore ranked 50th in receiving grade, 49th in yards per route run, and sixth in YAC per reception. Outside of his YAC numbers, I understand that the other metrics aren't eye-popping, but they are nowhere near wretched. With increased playing time in his second season, Moore can still capture the high-end ceiling I hoped for last year tied to Patrick Mahomes. Take him late in drafts as a stash, and hold on your bench. If Moore hits this year, he could be one of the best values in fantasy.

As we saw in KC last season, it is probably a full-blown WR committee in life after Tyreek Hill. Moore’s fantasy outlook is fragile with how many pass catchers are on the roster in KC.

But running QBs are the great equalizer in fantasy. Keep in mind that 60+ rushing yards and a score is the same as 300 passing yards in most leagues. The combination of Mark Andrews, Odell Beckham Jr., Rashod Bateman, and new rookie Zay Flowers is more than serviceable to keep opposing defenses honest.

days ago","text":"The Houston Texans looked like they struck gold with Dameon Pierce early on during the season, as the rookie running back looked like the early favorite to take home offensive rookie of the year honors with a hot start. Pierce stepped in and immediately became the team's bellcow in Week 2. From that time until Week 10, Pierce ranked 5th in the NFL in rushing yards (739) averaging north of 19 carries and 92 rushing yards per game. He was the fantasy RB12 overall and in points per game. Other Texans RBs combined for just 11 carries versus Pierce's 154 over this stretch. However, the Florida product seemed to have hit a wall in the middle of the year totaling just 16 rushing yards against Washington and Miami through Weeks 11-12. However, these two defenses would turn out to be some of the tougher matchups for all RBs, so that's likely the cause of Pierce's fall-off in production. The tackle-breaking machine more than proved that he still had juice left in the tank with two strong outings to conclude his season versus Dallas and Cleveland. However, he suffered a season-ending ankle injury that would knock him out for the rest of the season - just 61 yards away from 1,000 rushing yards on the year. Despite the missed games, he still finished 4th in missed tackles forced and 1st in missed tackles forced per attempt (28%) among RBs with at least 100 carries. Pierce should lead the Texans backfield in 2023, but an entirely new coaching staff and Pierce's 4th-round draft capital suggest that his undisputed workhorse role could change. Devin Singletary signed a one-year deal worth $3.75 million with the Texans, presumably to fill the role of  Pierce's primary backup. Singletary totaled just nine more carries than James Cook from Weeks 13-Week 20 but ended the year 10th in PFF rushing grade (two spots ahead of Pierce). \n\nOverall, Singletary probably won't unseat Pierce as the team's No. 1 rusher, but he poses a much bigger threat to Pierce's workload than JAGs like Rex Burkhead, Mike Boone, and Dare Ogunbowale. His PFF pass-blocking grade (73.2, 8th) might get him usage on passing downs as Pierce struggled in this capacity as a rookie (32.3, 52nd). Although it does work in Pierce's favor that Singletary has never flourished as an actual receiver, giving Pierce the slight edge on attaining a full three-down workload if he can shore up his pass protection in Year 2.\n\nSingletary's addition shouldn't completely change the way you view Pierce as it was highly unlikely the team would add zero running backs between now and the start of the season. He's not the worst running back they could have added, but he's hardly a reason to fully fade Pierce for fear that Singletary will carve out a massive role on offense.

While Rex Burkhead began the year as the starter, Pierce was eased in and eventually burst onto the scene as a reliable RB2. From Weeks 3-13, he was the RB13, averaging 12.6 fantasy points per game and running with the toughness that was advertised in preseason. The Texans’ offensive line is quietly one of the more solid units in the NFL, but the addition of Devin Singletary should not be overlooked. Pierce is a fringe RB2 in our book with some fears about the overall effectiveness of the offense with a rookie QB and less than stellar pass-catching weapons.","flexRank":79,"flexGrade":49,"flexGradeBadgeClass":"badge-graded-white","dynastyBlurb":"Pierce is a tough read in dynasty when you piece together all of the factors. His draft capital (4th round) is nothing special, but he proved as a rookie he can be a feature back in this league. The Texans continue to project as one of the worst teams in the NFL with a roster depleted of true difference-makers on both sides of the ball.

His career-worst finish in kicker fantasy scoring was 11th. Tucker has converted 90.5% of his career FG attempts and 98.8% of his extra-point tries.

Tua proved himself as a passer in 2022, leading all quarterbacks in passer rating (105.5), yards per attempt (8.9) and touchdown percentage (6.3%). But Tua has to be considered a concussion risk after a season in which he twice missed games due to brain injuries. He was knocked unconscious against the Bengals in Week 4 and didn't return until Week 7. He was also placed in the concussion protocol after a Week 16 game against the Packers and missed Miami's final two games. Were it not for concussion concerns. Tua would be drafted as a top-10 quarterback as a talented young passer in an explosive Dolphins offense that features two terrific WRs in Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. But with the possibility that another concussion could put Tua out of action indefinitely, it seems more sensible to regard Tua as a high-end QB2.

Jerick McKinnon was the RB7 in points per game, third in RB receptions at 35 with seven receiving TDs. The Chiefs scatback made the most of his opportunities as a receiver out of the backfield especially with Mecole Hardman sidelined. Because Hardman's injury correlated with a massive spike in usage for McKinnnon. In eight games with Hardman in the lineup, McKinnon was averaging close to just three targets per game. That number jumped to five in the nine games with Hardman out, as did McKinnon's receptions totals (2-to-4). His yardage also spiked from just under 20 yards to nearly 40 receiving yards per game. It's clear at this point in McKinnon's career that he cannot be deployed as anything more than a breather/pass-catching back in the rotation with another. He is already 30 years old and probably has the most fantasy value if he remains a Chief. His re-signing in KC is ideal for anyone invested in Pacheco, as McKinnon's return makes it less likely that KC invests significantly into another veteran running back option.

The question is whether the 32-year-old Ertz will be fit enough to continue his late-career resurgence following a major knee injury. After seven strong seasons with the Eagles, Ertz had a nightmarish 2020 in which he had 36-335-1 in 11 games, missing five games with a high-ankle sprain. Ertz started the 2021 season sluggishly, but then a trade to the Cardinals seemed to rejuvenate him, and he produced useful numbers until he went down last year. Not only is Ertz coming off a major injury, but he may have to share snaps and targets with talented young Cardinals TE Trey McBride. If you're thinking about investing in Ertz for 2023, insist on a discount.

The Atlanta TE caught just one of his 14 deep targets last season, and among all pass catchers who saw a 25+% target share in 2022, Pitts ranked dead last in catchable target rate.

Despite his six-game suspension, Williams remains an extremely talented wide receiver entering his sophomore season with a mountain of upside. Williams was placed in bubble wrap in 2022 by the Detroit Lions, who valued being careful with their blazing-fast rookie coming off a major injury (ACL tear). Assuming Williams is good to go for 2023, he's still the same player that ranked 13th in yards per route run among all FBS wide receivers in 2021 (minimum 50 targets). Williams could be the number two option in this passing attack when he returns behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown. Williams is a WR4 that could crush his ADP in 2023.

However, in shallow bench leagues where you need starting guys right out of the gate, don’t go reaching on a guy who’s a complete unknown.

With LA in a rebuilding year, Akers will again be a truly polarizing player. Did he do enough in the final 6 weeks as the NFL's leading rusher averaging 85 rushing yards per game to retain bell-cow-type usage?\n\nThe good news is that Sean McVay is remaining in Los Angeles, which bodes well for Akers to remain the go-to guy in the backfield. Recall, that Akers played 100% of the snaps in the Rams' season finale.\nAnd with so many needs on the Rams' current roster, they did not add any running backs in the draft until the sixth round. That means Akers will be competing for volume with Zach Evans, alongside Day 3 scrubs Kyren Williams and Ronnie Rivers.\n\nAnd although it seems impossible considering his career arc, Akers isn't even 24 years old yet. With free agency on the horizon, the Rams have all the reason in the world to ride Akers into the ground during a contract year.

He will likely miss the next 6 weeks, which will put him right on the cusp at the start of the season. Moss was traded to the Colts last season in exchange for Nyheim Hines, and he started the final four games after Jonathan Taylor got injured. Moss was decent in relief, tallying 4.8 yards per carry as PFF's 14th-highest-graded RB over the final four weeks. He showcased his tackle-breaking elusiveness that he excelled at in college, breaking 20 tackles (29% missed tackle rate). When healthy, Moss should be viewed as the handcuff to Jonathan Taylor as the team's primary rusher and goal-line back. But that grip on the No. 2 job will be tested with him slated to miss time.

about Pittman. Pittman was 17th in target share (25.6%) and nearly logged one of the quietest 100 reception seasons (99 receptions) in recent memory. He was 18th in red zone targets, first in total route wins, and third in route win rate, so the talent is still there for Pittman to finish with an even better 2023 season. With the team drafting Anthony Richardson, the biggest worry for Pittman now is passing volume. Even if he continues to draw targets at a strong rate, his target volume could hard cap his upside and lower his floor. Pittman is a WR3.

days ago","text":"Rachaad White saw his role grow during the second half of the season, forcing a timeshare with Leonard Fournette. From Weeks 10-17, White operated as the 1A in the Buccaneers' backfield averaging 11 fantasy points per game (RB26). He wasn't great as a rusher - four yards per carry, 66.4 PFF rushing grade - but no running back was particularly efficient behind Tampa's patchwork offensive line. The first-year rusher was still better than Fournette on the ground, as the veteran finished third-to-last in rushing EPA (-39.13). And there was no better display of White edging out Fournette on the field than in the first round of the NFL playoffs. Fournette carried the ball just 5 times for 11 yards while White started and rushed for 41 yards on 7 carries, adding 4-of-6 targets for 36 yards (56% snap share). White's superior season and proficiency as a receiver (50 receptions, 11th among all RBs) solidify him as the RB1 moving forward. Tampa Bay released Fournette, signed Chase Edmonds in free agency and added Sean Tucker as an undrafted free agent.

However, from Weeks 10-17, White averaged 53 percent of the snaps and 17 opportunities per game as Fournette was slowly detached from the offensive game plan. He became one of 11 rookie RBs over the last decade with 50+ receptions as a serviceable RB2 down the stretch. After the Buccaneers released Leonard Fournette and failed to spend any significant draft capital on an RB, White looks like the clear lead back unless you’re afraid of the ghosts of Ke’Shawn Vaughn and Chase Edmonds making some noise. The Tom Brady checkdowns won’t be there but White’s involvement as a pass-catcher isn’t going to suddenly vanish. He’s a low-end RB2 with some pop in full PPR leagues.","flexRank":66,"flexGrade":54,"flexGradeBadgeClass":"badge-graded-lightest-green","dynastyBlurb":"A bit older for a prospect, White certainly exceeded expectations as a 3rd round rookie and looks like he’s in a prime spot for 2023. Perhaps based on necessity alone, it seems White could finish third on the team in targets behind Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. He’s a solid trade target if you’re looking to build some depth in your RB room. But if this offense tanks, the team could be looking to find a new starter for 2024."},"sleeperData":{"fantasyProsId":"23891","college":"Arizona

In the nine games, Moore played at least 70% of the snaps; he only saw a 13.2% target share, zero end zone targets, and a 14% target per route run rate. In that sample, he only mustered 1.00 yards per route run. Woof! Those are atrocious numbers for a ballyhooed second-year receiver touted as the next rocket ship to the moon type player. His quarterback play was abysmal, but some blame for his production woes also lies at his feet. The big question is will he be a full-time player in 2023? Cleveland ranked 22nd in 11 personnel usage in 2022, so worries are warranted. Cleveland will likely roll with Amari Cooper and Donovan Peoples-Jones when they go two wide, so the Browns' bump in 11 usage has to happen for Moore to actualize a ceiling. He's a risky dice roll in the later rounds of drafts that could pay off, but a lot has to move in his favor for him to resume his rookie season career trajectory.

It was revealed that Dobbins needed another knee surgery after Week 6 and he was placed on IR until Week 14. It wasn't until Dobbins came back later in the year that fantasy managers got a glimpse of what the talented RB displayed as a rookie. The Ravens RB1 played in five games (including playoffs) averaging 6.6 yards per carry, 92 rushing yards, and 14 carries per game. Although he still split time with Gus Edwards - nearly identical carry totals in the Wild Card Round loss to the Bengals - and Dobbins' receiving usage remained obsolete with just 7 targets total to close out the year (5 of which came versus Cincinnati).

We were off him last year but the recovery from ACL and his solid end of season showing has us excited. He averaged 99 rushing yards and 11.6 fantasy points over his final four games, which were without Lamar Jackson.

Duce Staley (former Eagles RB coach), Frank Reich (former Eagles coach) and Josh McCown (former Eagles QB) have all seen what Sanders can do, and that surely played a part in bringing him on as the team's 1-for-1 replacement for new Chicago Bears running back D'Onta Foreman. At a minimum, Sanders will operate as the main back on early downs, while Chuba Hubbard (RB62) and Raheem Blackshear split work on third downs. But I say at a minimum because those guys still have to prove themselves to the new coaching staff to earn substantial roles. Sanders has already proven his worth with these coaches before. And last year he showed everyone what he was capable of when he finished as the RB10 in half-point scoring overall/RB13 in points per game from Weeks 1-17. He ended the year averaging just south of five yards per carry and scored 13 rushing TDs after scoring zero in 2021. His carries inside the 10-yard line ranked inside the top five among all RBs.\n\nAnd when Sanders saw his best-receiving usage to date - 50 receptions for 509 yards as a rookie in 2019 - it was under Staley's tenure.\n\nWith Sanders' uber-efficient rushing running behind an offensive line that finished 9th in adjusted line yards in 2022, Carolina is a great landing spot for him. His rushing alone should earn him production similar to what we saw from Foreman after the team traded away Christian McCaffrey. From Week 7 onward, Foreman sat as the RB21 in total points and RB22 in points per game. He ranked fourth in the NFL in total rushing yards (852). But his path to back-end RB2 status was not consistent whatsoever. Foreman rushed for over 110 yards in half of the last ten games, while finishing with fewer than 40 rushing yards in four of his others. His inconsistency was due to a lack of pass-game work causing him to be completely phased out of games that Carolina was out-matched in. But, I don't think that will necessarily be the case for Sanders. The former Eagle has the chance to be a full-blown workhorse with an expanded receiving role based on the four-year, $25 million ($13 million guaranteed) commitment from his new team.

While offenses with rookie QBs generally struggle, Sanders projects to see more than 300+ touches with little competition. His upside is immense and it wouldn’t be shocking for him to break down the door and be an RB1 in 2023.","flexRank":46,"flexGrade":63,"flexGradeBadgeClass":"badge-graded-light-green","dynastyBlurb":"Sanders could not have picked a better time to have a career year, cashing in with $13 million guaranteed. The four year contract is essentially a two year deal when you look at the final two void years. Only 26 years old, we are higher on Sanders than many in the dynasty community. He’s a solid RB2 for at least the next two years and should be given every opportunity to see 275+ touches."},"sleeperData":{"fantasyProsId":"18283","college":"Penn

days ago","text":"Devin Singletary signed a one-year deal worth $3.75 million with the Houston Texans, presumably to fill the role of Dameon Pierce's primary backup.\n\nSingletary operated as the 1A in the Buffalo Bills backfield for the majority of the 2022 season finishing the year as RB23 overall and RB27 in points per game. However, unlike the last two seasons that ended with strong finishes for the undersized rusher, Singletary was in a full-blown committee with rookie James Cook to close out the year. The first-year rusher averaged a 40% snap share over the team's final seven games, matching Singletary point-for-point (RB25 in points per game, 52% snap share).\n\nCook was also the superior rusher in the season's totality, capping off his year by averaging 5.3 yards per carry (5th). Singletary totaled just nine more carries than Cook from Weeks 13-Week 20 but ended the year 10th in PFF rushing grade (two spots ahead of Pierce).\n\nOverall, Singletary probably won't unseat Pierce as the team's No. 1 rusher, but he poses a much bigger threat to Pierce's workload than JAGs like Rex Burkhead, Mike Boone, and Dare Ogunbowale. His PFF pass-blocking grade (73.2, 8th) might get him usage on passing downs as Pierce struggled in this capacity as a rookie (32.3, 52nd). Although it does work in Pierce's favor that Singletary has never flourished as an actual receiver, giving Pierce the slight edge on attaining a full three-down workload if he can shore up his pass protection in Year 2.

Wilson's first year in Denver was bitterly disappointing, as he turned in the worst season of his 11-year career, with career lows in completion percentage (60.5%), passer rating (84.4) and touchdown passes (16), and a career high in sacks (55). Once a dangerous runner, Wilson doesn't run as much these days, and he doesn't escape pressure as easily. It's possible that this accomplished passer has a bounce-back season in 2023 under the tutelage of Sean Payton, but we can't assume that the 34-year-old Wilson will return to something close to vintage form.

He wasn’t afraid to chuck it deep, throwing 20+ yards downfield at the highest rate in the NFL. It's safe to say Mr. Unlimited was anything but...we'll see if this was just a one-year fluke with a bad scheme or if Russ has really lost it.

If we look deeper than the raw counting stats, London's future is incredibly bright. If earning targets is a skill (it is), then London proved to be among the league's elite. He ranked 22nd in raw target volume last year (117) with the fifth-highest target share (29.4%) and second-highest target per route run rate (32.4%) among wide receivers. London also blazed in efficiency stats ranking 16th in open rate (per ESPN analytics), tenth in PFF receiving grade, and 14th in yards per route run (minimum 50 targets). London gave a glimpse into his 2023 upside down the stretch last season. In Weeks 13-18, he was the WR20 in fantasy, even though he failed to score a touchdown in this span. London is a target vacuuming WR2 with WR1 upside in 2023.

Simply put, the guy is #goodatthegame and his profile says he has the talent to be a superstar in the league. However, QB play and offensive scheme have the potential to hold him back in 2023.

The soon-to-be 31-year-old was projected to be the back up for big free agent acquisition, Chase Edmonds. However, Edmonds fell out of favor extremely quickly and Mostert took over the starting job in Week 2. From that point until Week 8, Mostert averaged nearly ten half-points (RB21), 13.7 rushing attempts, and 62 rushing yards per game. The team quickly moved on from Edmonds before the trade deadline, replacing his spot on the roster with another ex-49ers running back, Jeff Wilson Jr.\n\nWilson joined the squad in Week 9 and immediately took on a sizable role. Wilson averaged 10 carries for 49 yards and nearly 0.4 TDs per game from Weeks 9 through 18. Mostert averaged an eerily similar workload with ten carries for 55 yards and 0.25 TDs per game. The two both missed one game entirely over this stretch, but posted an almost identical fantasy point-per-game output at ten points per game (RB32/33) with Wilson getting the slight lean in terms of expected points based on usage. Wilson out-targeted Mostert 23 to 20. However, Mostert was the superior back on a per-touch basis. The journeyman running back was superior in yards after contact per attempt (4.01 versus 2.33) and caught 18 of his 20 targets. Wilson only converted 12 of his 23 targets into receptions.\n\nThe team opted to bring back Mostert on a two-year deal ($5.6MM, $2.2MM guaranteed) and also re-sign Wilson to a 2-year deal worth up to $8.2 million ($2.65MM guaranteed). Miami also drafted speed demon Devon Achane in the 3rd round. His speed element overlaps most with Mostert (a fellow former track star) suggesting Achane's playing time will likely come at the expense of Mostert and not Wilson.

Meanwhile, Pollard finished the season as the fantasy RB7 - despite ranking outside the top 25 in touches per game - as PFF's 3rd-highest graded running back. Pollard scored more fantasy points than any other running back (19.3 per game) from Weeks 7-16 when he was consistently playing 53% or more of the snaps as the team's featured back. The team added Ronald Jones in free agency and drafted Deuce Vaughn late on Day 3, but neither are threats to a healthy Pollard's touch volume. He's slated to be a locked-and-loaded fantasy RB1 pending any FA addition to the backfield.

Last year was in fact Mike McCarthy’s most run-heavy year of his coaching career but don’t tell the illustrious duo of McCarthy/Schottenheimer what they should do!

days ago","text":"D'Onta Foreman inked a one-year deal worth $3 million with the Chicago Bears to replace David Montgomery in the Bears backfield alongside Khalil Herbert, Travis Homer and 2023 4th-round draft pick Roschon Johnson. Per Aaron Wilson, Foreman also had interest from the Bills, Panthers, and Giants but chose to go with the Bears.\n\nThe interest doesn't come as a surprise after Foreman's breakout play in 2022. From Week 7 on, Foreman was the RB21 in fantasy scoring and RB22 in fantasy points per game. He ranked fourth in the NFL in rushing yards (852) over that span. But his path to back-end RB2 status was not consistent whatsoever. Foreman rushed for more than 110 yards in half of his last 10 games while finishing with fewer than 40 rushing yards in four of the others. His weekly half-point PPR fantasy finishes over those last 10 games were RB13, RB5, RB42, RB9, RB48, RB27, RB27, RB70, RB3, and RB53. Foreman was also a zero in the passing game, with just five receptions as the team's starter.\n\nEven so, Foreman's flashes of high-end early-down starting potential for two straight seasons are going to earn him opportunities in Chicago. Even though Khalil Herbert has shown out on limited opportunities, it's hard to envision anything but another RB usage split between a trio of capable RBs similar to the split between Herbert and Montgomery last season.

He absolutely annihilated the Falcons totalling 248 rushing yards and four scores in two games against them. He landed a one-year deal with Chicago where he mixes in with Khalil Herbert and rookie Roschon Johnson to form a confusing backfield.

In Washington, Wentz is now on his 3rd life with a new cast of pass-catchers. One drive he can look like an All-Pro and the next you’re wondering if maybe he knows which sport he’s playing out there.

Per Sports Info Solutions' total points model, Spears finished third in total points per game and total EPA generated per game. He also finished second in the class in pass pro snaps per game (8.1), something NFL coaches will drool over. \n\nThroughout his career, he boasts an impressive 3.00 yards per play (seventh best in the class) - a great indicator of future success at the NFL level. \n\nThe Titans selected Spears in the 3rd round of the 2023 NFL Draft despite scary reports regarding Spears' short shelf life based on previous knee injuries.

days ago","text":"Kenneth Walker III stood as the RB8 from Weeks 6-17 after Rashaad Penny was placed on IR with a season-ending injury. The rookie was the RB9 in points per game. If you remove the two games, he missed due to injury (Weeks 13/14) he averaged 16.4 fantasy points per game, which would have placed him as the RB8 in points per game. Walker's late ADP last season made him a draft-day steal. \nWe all knew that Rashaad Penny was never going to be \"the guy\" for the long run based on his injury track record and that Walker would likely take over RB1 duties as an uber-talented second-round pick. He did just that and got absolutely FED after returning from a late-season ankle injury. Walker was either consistently playing 70 percent-plus snaps or carrying the ball 23-plus times. And at times, we even saw Walker earn targets while leading the backfield in routes run. \nBut overall, he underwhelmed as a receiver as he did at the college level. And his tendency to look for home runs rushes resulted in a rushing success rate that ranked second-to-last (31.4%) among rushers with at least 100 carries in 2022. He also missed games because of injuries.\nAnd his path to RB1 upside will be that much tougher to realize after the team added Zach Charbonnet in the second round of this year's draft. Charbonnet posted the 5th-highest PFF receiving grade and tied for first in receptions per game (3.7) among his draft class. The former UCLA running back also finished with the highest positive run rate (57%) and lowest bust rate (4%) among drafted running backs.\nThe rookie Seahawk can't deliver explosive rushes like Walker, but he can be trusted to hit doubles as a rusher and receiver consistently. That's concerning for those hoping Walker was stepping into a workhorse role this season, which was very appealing about his fantasy profile last year.\nAnd to add literal insult to injury, Walker has popped up this offseason with a groin injury, forcing him to miss time in training camp. The rhetoric out of the Seahawks' camp is that this is they are just being overly cautious, so it's not a MAJOR cause for concern. However, it needs to be noted that Walker missed two games last season and dealt with a sports hernia early on during last offseason that required surgery. He missed Week 1 last year as a result but returned in Week 2.  \nAll in all, I'd buy the dip his \"injury status\" calls for. Because the bigger injury is to his teammate Charbonnet, who is out indefinitely with a shoulder injury. Because Charbonnet caused the big dip in Walker's ADP after the NFL Draft, any missed time by the rookie is a massive win for KW3. The other RBs on Seahawks depth chart include fourth-year pro DeeJay Dallas and 2023 7th-rounder Kenny McIntosh.

The big plays were glorious as he rattled off 17 runs for 15+ yards, the 3rd most among RBs and the most for a rookie RB since Saquon Barkley. Walker was shaping up to be a 1st round redraft pick before the Seahawks inexplicably decided to take Zach Charbonnet in the late second round. It’s going to be a good NFL move but puts a damper on Walker’s ceiling especially in the passing game.

The workload might be 60-40 favoring Walker over Charbonnet but it’s still a far cry from the 20+ opportunities per game he was seeing as the starter.

Thomas wasn't a full-time player, though, as he saw only a 77.3% route run rate which could also speak to his health. If he wasn't fully healthy at any time last year, it would make sense for the team to limit his snaps some trying to conserve him.

With a strong red zone role, he could still produce a WR3 season with those peripherals.

But in 2020, Charbonnet's numbers regressed in a six-game season for Michigan due to COVID-19. He split time with Haskins again, while also losing out to work to another NFL-drafted Chris Evans and up-and-coming running back star, Blake Corum. Charbonnet was part of a major running back by the committee as a Wolverine so he transferred to UCLA in 2021 and immediately saw his production skyrocket. He would post a 25% dominator rating as a junior, finishing third among all RBs in PFF rushing grade. Charbonnet's 2022 senior production was also elite, as he finished 4th in PFF rushing grade among all RBs topping his grade from the year before. But more importantly, for fantasy purposes, the 6-foot, 214-pound running back improved on his receiving game, catching 37 balls for 320 yards on 44 targets. He posted the 5th-highest PFF receiving grade and tied for first in receptions per game (3.7) among his draft class. The former UCLA running back also finished with the highest positive run rate (57%) and lowest bust rate (4%) among drafted running backs.\nThe Seattle Seahawks selected Charbonnet in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft (52nd overall) pairing him with last year's second-round pick, Kenneth Walker III. Charbonnet can't deliver the home run rushes like Walker, but he can be trusted to hit doubles as a rusher and receiver consistently. Charbonnet's 3-down skill set combined with his draft capital suggests he will be used by the Seahawks plenty as a rookie, and he could end up being the better fantasy asset compared to Walker. \nKeep in mind that head coach Pete Carroll is never afraid to shake things up when it comes to his backfield. The team drafted Rashaad Penny in the 1st round of the 2018 NFL Draft. But former 7th-round draft pick Chris Carson was the team's leading rusher in 2018, 2019 and 2020. One of Charbonnet's closest comparisons based on his size and weight is Carson.\nUnfortunately for Charbonnet, he has already picked up a shoulder injury during the preseason. Head coach Pete Carroll has labeled him \"out indefinitely.\" Not good.  Carroll is usually one of the most optimistic when it comes to his players' availability. The fact that \"indefinitely\" is already being thrown around is bad. Jamal Adams was out indefinitely with finger injuries this time last year. He was ready for Week 1. But that was after surgery. Adams came back for Week 1 before missing the rest of the season with a different injury. Torn quad. But also last year, Seattle linebacker Darryl Johnson was labeled out indefinitely after Week 4. Was placed on IR and never returned.\nBecause Charbonnet has already practiced he can't be put on PUP, making IR his next logical spot as the roster gets trimmed down to 53 (Aug 29th). However, this will have to wait until the season starts...so Charbonnet can return to the team at some point (will have to miss at least 4 games).\nIf he gets put on IR before the season...He's done for the 2023 season. As it stands right now, I'd bet Charbonnet misses at least the first month of the season...if not more. That's obviously a major boost for Kenneth Walker, and likely gives more fantasy value to fourth-year pro DeeJay Dallas and 2023 7th-rounder Kenny McIntosh.

The Vikings were a weekly roller coaster going 11-0 in one-score games but Kirk averaged 280 yards and two passing TDs in those contests. He will never be able to compete with the top tier thanks to his limited mobility, but he’s a dependable late-round QB every single year.","flexRank":0,"flexGrade":0,"flexGradeBadgeClass":null,"dynastyBlurb":"Cousins is not guaranteed to be the Vikings QB beyond 2023. He's only under contract for one more year but your league-mates might not realize that…The Minnesota offense definitely looked more high-powered with an emphasis on throwing on early downs but for fantasy, he actually had a lower points per game and TD rate than the previous two years.

Evans would go on to transfer to Ole Miss at the start of the 2022 season, where he posted his best college counting stats to date with a 17 percent dominator rating. His 15% boom percentage per Sports Info Solutions led all RBs in his class. \n\nHowever, he failed to fully take over at the backfield as he did at TCU, losing out on touches to freshman running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nThe fact that Evans has struggled to fully take over a backfield at the college level -- along with no contributing role as a receiver -- is a major red flag as he makes his way into the NFL, but his efficient play when on the field suggests he can deliver when called upon. His career average of 3.47 yards per play ranks second-best among the incoming rookie RBs I sampled earlier this offseason. \n\nYards per play is a great indicator of future success, with recent late-round standouts in that category the past two years including Elijah Mitchell, Rhamondre Stevenson, Rachaad White, and Tyler Allgeier. Evans also boasts decent size at 5-foot-11 and 202 pounds - albeit the weight he measured at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine was much lighter than his listed weight at Ole Miss (216 pounds). \n\nAt the Ole Miss pro day, Evans posted a 4.45 40-time, ran a 4.26 20-yard shuttle and finished the 3-cone drill in 7.08 seconds.\n\nIn the 2023 NFL Draft L.A. traded No. 252 and a sixth-round pick in 2024 to the Bills for Pick 215, where they selected the Ole Miss running back.

That type of upside in his rookie season shouldn't be ignored in an offensive system that could challenge for the league lead in passing attempts and play volume. Even if he doesn't supplant Williams this season, Johnston offers this offense a different element as a RAC specialist. Last year Johnston ranked sixth in YAC per reception and 11th in missed tackles forced (minimum 50 targets per PFF). Kellen Moore can design looks for Justin Herbert to get Johnston the ball in space and let him do his thing.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"ROOKIE","text":"The Chargers recognized they need a WR to compliment Mike Williams and Keenan Allen. Johnston fits the bill thanks to his explosiveness and ability to make plays down the field. In college, he was a YAC machine and profiles as a dangerous playmaker with the ball in his hands. In Year 1, however, it might take some time for Johnston to earn a role with Williams, Keenan and Austin Ekeler getting volume out of the backfield. He is a candidate to earn a role as the season goes on and of course, Big Mike and Allen have been known to miss a game or two…or ten.

His efficiency metrics are the real tale of the tape, as he was 33rd in yards per route run, 35th in route win rate, and 47th in open rate (per ESPN analytics). With declining metrics and an uncertain quarterback situation in Tampa Bay, Evans is a WR3.

days ago","text":"Texas running back Bijan Robinson was the consensus No. 1 RB across all pre-draft publications and was selected 8th overall in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. \nRobinson finished the 2022 college football season as PFF's second highest-graded rusher in the FBS, tallying 18 rushing TDs and 1,575 rushing yards en route to a 37% dominator rating in his final year as a Texas Longhorn. He forced 104 missed tackles (40% broken tackle rate) which has shown to be super predictive of success rushing at the NFL level. Compared to last year's running back class, only Breece Hall posted a higher dominator rating (40%). Factor in that Robinson also finished third among RBs in yards per catch (16.5) with zero drops and there's no question as to why he's the locked-in 1.01 for rookie drafts and top-3-ranked running back in season-long formats. At 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds, Robinson has the requisite size and all the tools to be a successful three-down running back in Arthur Smith's offense. Last season in Atlanta's offense, Tyler Allgeier finished as PFF's highest-graded rookie running back and 6th in rushing EPA as a former 5th-round pick. Allgeier also averaged nearly 18 carries and 96 rushing yards per game from Week 13 onward. If Robinson inherits that workload, he is easily projecting 300-plus carries and 1,500 rushing yards in an offense that ranked first in early down run rate and +13% in run rate above expectation.

The Texas A&M 4.32 RB speedster rushed for 1,100 yards and 8 rushing TDs while catching 36 balls (3.6 per game) for 196 yards on 44 targets. Good for a 33% dominator rating a year after earning a 26% dominator rating while splitting time with Spiller. And although Achane will likely go through the wringer from NFL draft pundits when it comes to his smaller stature - 5-foot-81/2, 188 pounds - he put any \"can he handle a large workload\" concern to rest in his final game versus LSU. Achane totaled 38 carries for 215 rushing yards and two TDs after missing a few games with an injury. \n\nAchane ended his final college season with the second highest \"hit at the line\" positive run percentage, making the most of unfortunate situations when the defense pierced through the offensive line. \n\nThe speedster also offers top-tier kickoff return ability, which helped boost his draft stock and get him active on game days. Achane finished as PFF's 3rd-highest graded kick returner among 2023 draft-eligible players. That ensures he will be suiting up for the Miami Dolphins early on this season, after they selected him in the 3rd round of the 2023 NFL Draft. It was the highest draft pick used on a running back by the Dolphins since Kenyan Drake.\n\n Miami is the perfect fit for Achane; his elite track speed in an outside zone running offense is going to terrify defenses. And it's not too crazy to think Achane can rise the depth chart that currently consists of a 31-year-old injury-prone Raheem Mostert and journeyman Jeff Wilson Jr.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"ROOKIE","text":"Some people live their lives a quarter mile at a time and others are gone in 60 seconds.

The ex-Packers WR showed the entire world he didn't need Aaron Rodgers, hanging a league-leading 32.3% target share while finishing third in fantasy points per game (16.8). He even showed that he could thrive without Derek Carr, catching 7 balls for 153 yards and 2 TDs in a Week 17 contest with Jarrett Stidham under center.\n\nThe obvious concerns about Adams are his age (will be 31 in December) and how he will gel with injury-prone Jimmy Garoppolo as his new QB. But Adams showed zero signs of aging with the league's fifth-highest yards per route run (2.45) as PFF's second-highest graded WR. I also don't believe the fit with Jimmy G is as poor as many may lead on. Garoppolo is an accurate quarterback - 6th in completion rate last season - which should allow Adams to vacuum up targets and add yardage after the catch.\n\nI also fully expect any QB issues to be mitigated to some extent by sheer volume, as the depth chart is barren behind Adams and Jakobi Meyers for targets. Hunter Renfrow is expected to be traded or cut by June 1st.

He finished second in carries and third in rushing yards (23.4 touches per game) while also posting career highs in targets, receptions and yards per route run. The bad offensive situation hardly influenced Henry's fantasy numbers and he did not seem hampered by the foot injury that knocked him out of the second half of the 2021 season. Fading Henry in 2022 was betting on him to hit the wall playing behind a shaky offensive line finally. And that bet did not go well. But another year of a heavy workload combined with the Titans' grim 2023 outlook with major questions on offense, will bring concerns about drafting Henry early in 2023.

He’s still elite but keep in mind that Tennessee’s window of opportunity is closing with Tannehill and Henry in contract years.

After he returned from injury, the season's final five games offered a clearer view of what a breakout sophomore season for Dotson could look like. In Weeks 13-18 of last season, Dotson ranked 20th in target share (24%), third in end zone target share (50%), 17th in weighted opportunity, and 13th in yards per route run. Sam Howell or Jacoby Brissett at the helm in 2023 doesn't inspire a ton of confidence, but Dotson is a skilled wide receiver well-versed from his college days in dealing with pitiful quarterback play. Dotson is a WR4/5 that could take a huge leap in his second season. I won't rule out him giving Terry McLaurin a run for his money for the team lead in targets this season.

But further baked into his upside case is that should Harris miss anytime, the 215-pound Warren would inherit bell-cow duties without any other Steelers RBs behind him yearning for touches.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"SLEEPER","text":"The Steelers spent significant draft capital on an offensive lineman in Round 1 then got one of the better blocking TEs in Darnell Washington later in the draft. We expect Kenny Pickett to take a step forward in year two, and while that should primarily benefit Najee Harris, it will also benefit his backfield compadre, Jaylen Warren. As a rookie last year, Warren averaged 4.9 yards per attempt and logged the same yards after contact per attempt numbers as Jonathan Taylor and Travis Etienne. He’s an effective back who will go extremely late in drafts. Should the Steelers decide to scale back Najee’s workload or if Harris misses time, Warren would become a plug and play top-15 weekly option. As the unquestioned backup to Najee, throwing Warren on the end of your bench as a late round pick isn’t the worst idea in the world.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"23479","position":"RUNNINGBACK","overallPoints":122,"avgPoints":7.2,"positionRank":42,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":478,"rushingTouchdowns":2,"receptions":34,"receivingYards":250,"receivingTouchdowns":1,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":1,"risk":3,"name":"Jaylen Warren","blurb":"The former undrafted free agent from Oklahoma State slowly worked his way into the backfield mix with Najee Harris by the end of the season.

AG was still the much more involved receiver with an impressive 14% target share - three catches, four targets and 22 receiving yards per game - but he was out-carried 9.7 rushing attempts per game to 16.7 by Robinson. B-Rob's status as the starter on early downs entering the season will surely make Gibson - a free agent at the end of 2023 - an enticing late-round running back option based on his pass-catching prowess and RB1 fantasy production his first two years in the league. Keep in mind, that J.D. McKissic is coming off a neck injury with an out in his contract, slating Gibson to reprise the full-blown receiving role for Washington. Gibson's 80.5 PFF receiving grade ranked third among all RBs in 2022.

Ekeler was fully unlocked as a receiver with Keenan Allen and Mike Williams combining for 13 missed games. Until the Chargers WRs can prove they can stand the test of a 17-game season, Ekeler will remain the focal point of LA's offense.

Entering a contract year, there was some off-season chatter that he could be moved around the NFL Draft but the team made it clear he’s still their guy.

days ago","text":"Rashaad Penny inked a one-year deal with the Eagles reportedly worth $1.35 million with $600,000 guaranteed and a max value of $2.1 million. It's not much but it puts him in the conversation to be the team's early-down lead back in full Miles Sanders fashion. In his five games played before his injury in 2022, Penny averaged over six yards per carry. He ranked second among all RBs in rushing percentage that resulted in 10-plus yards (17.5%).\n\nHis only game where he failed to surpass 54 yards on the ground was against the eventual number one run defensive unit: the San Francisco 49ers. The on-field production and talent have never been in question with Penny. It's just been the availability due to health that has been the big issue. Quarterback Jalen Hurts' presence at the goal line will obviously hinder Penny's TD potential to some extent but make no mistake that Penny's explosive game means he can score beyond just the 5-yard line. Of his 14 career touchdowns, 11 have come on 10-yard-plus plays. Seven (50%) have been 30-plus plays from scrimmage.\n\nAlthough it should be noted that the Eagles traded for D'Andre Swift and re-signed Boston Scott. Penny's deal is worth $1.35 million with $600,000 guaranteed - less than Scott's $2 million with $1.08 guaranteed.  Swift is the superior pass-catcher, but an argument can be made that Penny is as good is not better as a pure rusher.

In Herbert's defense, he gutted it out through a rib cartilage fracture sustained in an early-season Thursday-night game vs. the Chiefs, and Herbert's top two receivers, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, both missed time with injuries. The Chargers have jettisoned oft-criticized offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, replacing him with Kellen Moore.

Although his 59 catches did rank second on the team behind only Allen Lazard, Jones caught fewer passes than the year before. His catches per game (3.5) were identical to the year before. He saw a career-high in targets (72), but that was based on his 17 games played. His 4.3 targets per game were also identical to the year before. And Jones was the epitome of a boom-or-bust running back that his fantasy managers are too familiar with that isn't super obvious based on his RB9 finish and RB12 status in points per game. A.J. Dillon got more involved in the second half of the season, especially in the red zone. From Week 9 onward, Dillon out-carried Jones inside the 10-yard line 14 to 5. And they scored the same amount of points total from Week 11 through Week 17, with Dillion scoring 6 rushing TDs. If Dillon's goal-line role carries over from the tail-end of the 2022 season, that significantly could hinder Jones' fantasy upside even after a year that saw the 28-year-old finish second in PFF rushing grade. Dillon finished 5th in PFF rushing grade last season and will hit free agency at the end of the 2023 season.

The key was being a constant in the passing game, totaling 59 receptions and five TDs thanks to being targeted on 22.8 percent of his routes, the highest of his career. With Jordan Love now calling the shots, Jones’ run could be coming to an end. It’s hard envisioning this offense having the same levels of efficiency Rodgers showed for so many years. With A.J.

That accomplishment puts Allgeier into an elite company with RBs such as Jonathan Taylor, Josh Jacobs, Nick Chubb, Alvin Kamara and Rhamondre Stevenson  - all who were top-8 fantasy RBs in their second seasons after taking home the crown as PFF's highest-graded rookie RB in their first years. Allgeier's strong finish was the driving force behind his final standing - 6th among all RBs in rushing EPA -  as the team unleashed him from Week 13 onward. He was the RB11 in half-point scoring points per game averaging 17.8 carries and 96 rushing yards per game. Alas, Allgeier's accomplishments were all for naught as his fantasy value was immediately vaporized after the team decided to draft Bijan Robinson 8th overall. It puts Allgeier into straight backup duties, where he likely will have no fantasy value without a Robinson injury. At least fantasy managers and zero-RB zealots can be assured that Allgeier will produce if/when called upon based on his rookie-year accolades.

He's had two top-12 finishes in half-point PPR formats, however, and the combination of youth and athleticism gives him plausible fantasy upside in the later rounds of drafts. It's worth noting, however, that with the selection of WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the first round of the NFL Draft, the Seahawks might go with more three-WR sets and fewer two-TE sets, which could mean lower snap counts for Fant.

After an offseason workout in rainy Pittsburgh, he entered his house with an umbrella still drawn and tripped over his black cat, which sent him hurdling into his full-length entryway mirror, thus shattering it into a million pieces. This unlikely yet possible turn of events is the only possible explanation for his wretchedly unlucky season. Despite ranking 13th in target share, tenth in red zone targets, and the WR20 in expected fantasy points per game, Johnson finished the season with zero touchdowns as the WR39 in fantasy points per game. Kenny Pickett's play was a factor, but Johnson simply had a terrible run-out. Regression is coming for Johnson and this offense. Johnson still ranked 11th in total route wins, so no skill dropoff is involved here. It's just a case of legendarily bad luck. Johnson is a WR3 with top-15 upside.

In fact, Johnson’s 147 targets with zero TDs was an NFL record - that’s how unlucky he was. If he scores between five and eight TDs as he’s done every year prior to 2022, we’re having a much different conversation about DJ’s 2023 outlook.

days ago","text":"Alexander Mattison smashed in most games that Dalvin Cook missed from 2020-2021. The Vikings RB2 posted five games with at least 23 touches over that stretch, including two games with 32 touches when Cook was sidelined. He averaged 23.7 PPR points and 90 rushing yards per game in those contests. The problem in 2022, was that Mattison never got the opportunity to carve out a bell cow role because Cook stayed healthy for the entire season. Aside from the occasional goal-line touch, Mattison operated strictly as RB2 for Minnesota. And that hurt Mattison's chances of boosting his stock in free agency as he settled in on returning to his old team on a 2-year, $7MM contract with $6.35MM guaranteed.\n\nThe 25-year-old running back was at least efficient in 2022 when he carried the ball, finishing with a career-high 84.2 PFF rushing grade which ranked 15th among 61 running backs with at least 70 carries in 2022. \n\nAnd although, he's never been a featured back for an entire season -- the glimpses of him in a full-time role as a Viking shed some light on his potential upside should he ascend to RB1 status. Dalvin Cook has been released, suggesting the job is Mattison's to lose. Currently, it's Ty Chandler, DeWayne McBride and Kene Nwangwu behind him on the depth chart. Still, there are risks involved selecting Mattison high in 2023 as there's a lot of projection with him as the team's featured back for an entire season. That's something he has never done. And drafting players simply on the situation tends to not work favorably in the long run.\n\nRemember, nobody ever vied for Mattison to get touches over Cook over the last four weeks. He was always the inferior back. So although he's no longer the most inferior back on the roster, that doesn't mean he is back to get overly excited about for fantasy football.

days ago","text":"Sanders led all kickers in fantasy scoring in 2020, but he's been less prolific the last two years, finishing K21 in 2021 and K14 in 2022. Accuracy has been an issue for Sanders the last two seasons. After hitting only 74.2% of his FG attempts in 2021, he bumped his conversion rate to a barely acceptable 81.3% last year. But if Sanders can get back to the 90% level he reached in 2020 and as a rookie in 2018, he'll likely be among the highest-scoring kickers yet again, as the Miami offense should again be above-average. Another selling point on Sanders is that he plays his home games in South Florida, where the weather is typically cooperative -- especially late in the season, when other kickers often have to deal with cold, windy conditions.

Has his value dropped further after a down 2022 season? Yep. That's exactly why his ADP has dipped to the basement where it resides. Claypool showed promise of fulfilling his rookie season promise in three games with the Bears, in which he played at least 63% of the snaps. In that small three-game sample, he saw a 22.1% target share, a 50% end zone target share, 1.77 yards per route run, and a 28% target per route run rate.

days ago","text":"When James Conner was healthy in 2022, it was hard to argue with his elite production and role in the Arizona Cardinals offense. He was the RB4 overall in his last eight games, averaging 17 fantasy points per game (RB6, RB10 in expected points per game) while playing over 90% of his team's snaps in five contests. No other Cardinals running back was able to threaten Conner's volume, which led to him to an absurd workload. And Arizona did not invest anything into the No. 2 running back position this offseason so we could easily see Conner's high workload remain intact while he stays healthy. Keen fantasy managers need to be aware of his durability issues. He missed four games entirely and left three other games early because of injuries. Conner is entering his age-28 season. But the team has all the incentive in the world to ride him into the ground with a potential out in his contract at the end of the season.

His age (28) might be concerning but the RB depth chart behind him in Arizona is barren. Opportunity is king in fantasy football and Conner averaged 18.5 opportunities per game in 2022. That workload projection should be relatively similar this year even if Kyler Murray gets off to a slow start. In fact, the Cardinals relied upon Conner even more last year when Kyler was out as he averaged 104 total yards and nearly 20 fantasy points per game.

He was a true workhorse, seeing 34 percent of the team’s total rush attempts and targets, tied with Christian McCaffrey for 4th highest during that span.

Mahomes led all players in fantasy scoring last season with 428.4 points, giving him his second QB1 finish. In his five full seasons as a starter, Mahomes has averaged 303 passing yards and 23.95 fantasy points per game. Playing his first season without WR Tyreek Hill, who left for Miami, Mahomes finished the 2022 season with a career-high 5,250 passing yards and a league-high 41 TD passes.

He broke his own record for most top-12 performances in a season with 15. Despite losing Tyreek Hill, Mahomes improvised on the fly, and 34 of 41 of his passing TDs (83 %) came inside the red zone. He said before the season “I’ll be able to spread the ball around more this year” and he delivered with 11 different pass-catchers hauling in a TD. Apart from Travis Kelce, it’s hard betting on anyone else but when it comes to Mahomes, we’re not betting against him repeating his magic.

days ago","text":"It truly was a tale of two seasons for Joe Mixon. In Weeks 1-8, Mixon struggled immensely averaging 3.3 yards per carry as the RB19 in points per game. No running back scored fewer fantasy points versus expected because he just couldn't seem to find the end zone. But as the newer pieces of the offensive line started to gel, Mixon's production took off in the form of positive touchdown regression. He finished the season (including the postseason) as PFF's second-highest-graded running back headlined by an elite 5-touchdown game versus the Panthers in Week 9. In his eight healthy games from Weeks 9 to the conference championship, he averaged 16.7 fantasy points per game (equivalent to RB5 on the season). All in all, Mixon finished 6th in touches per game (19.5) and second in carries inside the 10-yard line (28) from Weeks 1-17, but only scored five touchdowns. The career-high receiving usage (60 catches for 441 yards on 70 targets) paved the way for Mixon's RB8 finish in points per game. However, it should be noted that the team did involve Samaje Perine more down the stretch after he filled in admirably during Mixon's injury (Weeks 11-13). Perine out-snapped Mixon in two of the Bengals' three playoff games and routinely ran more routes. But Mixon still averaged nearly four catches per game. I wouldn't envision his receiving role on early downs changing even if he loses snaps to another RB on third downs. Former Michigan running back Chris Evans projects to take a larger role on third downs after Samaje Perine signed with the Denver Broncos.

His off-the-field legal issues also create a cloud of unknowns, but it seems he remains the Bengals’ lead RB per head coach Zac Taylor.

Metcalf and Tyler Lockett. These are valid concerns, but before I push back against them, let's discuss Smith-Njigba as a talent. In 2021 he was first in yards per route run and first in PFF receiving grade (minimum 50 targets per PFF) while drawing a 22.7% target share alongside Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave. Smith-Njigba gets typecast as a low aDOT player, but he has also shown the ability to win downfield. In 2021 he was ninth in yards per route run and tied for first in PFF's deep receiving grade (minimum 15 deep targets per PFF). Smith-Njigba is an elite-level prospect. With that said, I have a hard time believing the Seahawks burnt a first-round pick on a player they don't plan to feature, so I believe they will run a ton of 11 personnel in 2023. Regarding the subject of target share, Smith-Njigba can put those concerns to rest quickly and hit the ground running as the second option in this passing attack. While I don't want to take anything away from Tyler Lockett, he hasn't been a high-end target earner. Over the last four seasons, he's never ranked higher than 36th in target per route run rate. The addition of Smith-Njigba can allow Lockett to return to stretching the field. Since 2019 he's ranked top-12 in deep targets twice. Last year he logged the second-lowest aDOT of his career and the lowest YAC per reception mark. Smith-Njigba should garner targets early and often in 2023. Draft him and enjoy.

WR22 overall and WR20 in expected points per game.\nEntering 2023, Wilson will have a major upgrade at quarterback with Aaron Rodgers under center.

Rodgers completed 64.6% of his passes last season, which was close to his career average (65.3%).\nWilson is also a prime candidate to experience positive TD regression after finishing as just one of three WRs with 1,000 receiving yards to score fewer than 5 TDs.
