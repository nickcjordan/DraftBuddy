He should become a favorite of Sam Darnold in the red zone, as he plucks the ball out of the air with his strong mitts. He'll be battling with Breshad Perriman for targets on the perimeter, while Jamison Crowder remains the safety valve in the slot. Robby Anderson did see 96 targets last year while Demaryius Thomas saw 58 of them (in 11 games), so there's room for a fantasy producer. The issue is that Mims is a rookie who hasn't seen any preseason action and hasn't had much time to be around the team. The same can be said for Perriman, so there's a route to immediate production with Mims, though Adam Gase has not been friendly to perimeter wide receivers. Over the last four years, his top receivers were Jarvis Landry (twice), Danny Amendola, and Jamison Crowder... all slot receivers. It's best to be cautious with rookie wide receivers, especially this year, even if I like who Mims is as a player. Selecting him in one of the final rounds makes sense, as you'll find out what you have over the first two weeks and decide whether you want to cut bait or stick with him.

Now, we get Philip Rivers, the guy who's supported a top-11 tight end in all but one season in his long career, yet none of the Colts tight ends are being drafted in the top 18 at the position? The logical one is Doyle, who has now seen 105 targets in 22 games under Frank Reich. Burton is similar in the way that he's more of a move tight end while Doyle is the traditional one who'll be on the field most of the time. In a year where the Colts threw the ball just 513 times, it's good to see Doyle with at least four targets in 12-of-15 games.

Unfortunately, Jefferson wound up on the COVID list and is being forced to miss a lot of camp. Still, he's a route-running technician who's playing behind a 30-year-old receiver who's been dealing with back issues. There's an avenue where Jefferson is relied upon as a rookie more than most think, though it would likely require Thielen to be out of the lineup. Under Gary Kubiak/Kevin Stefanski last year, the wide receivers saw just 43.2 percent of the target share (4th-lowest mark in the NFL), making it very difficult for multiple options to be fantasy relevant on a week-to-week basis. Because of that, Jefferson is essentially just a wide receiver handcuff.

The biggest downside is the run-heavy Vikings offense. In 2019, even with Adam Thielen missing six games, Diggs only saw 94 targets.

days ago","text":"Did you know that 36.4 percent of Allen's fantasy production came on the ground last year? His nine rushing touchdowns were the sixth-most all-time, while his 631 rushing yards ranked 18th on that list. According to where his carries took place on the field, he scored 30.97 more fantasy points than he was supposed to on the ground alone. As a passer, he scored 1.66 fewer fantasy points than expected. The Bills want to play solid defense with a ball control style offense, and knowing Allen's strengths, they'll be running the ball quite a bit. The addition of Zack Moss to the backfield will lower Allen's rushing touchdown ceiling, as Moss is a better version of 2019's Frank Gore. Not many realize Gore ranked 13th among running backs for carries inside the five-yard-line. Adding Stefon Diggs will certainly help his choices when scanning the field, but Allen needs to get better completing the deep ball. My issue with Allen is his inconsistency, and I can best explain it with this stat: It took 18.6 fantasy points on average to finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2019. Allen hit that mark just 43.8 percent of the time, which was worse than Ryan Fitzpatrick, and the same percentage as Jared Goff. Sure, the booms will be bigger with Allen than those guys, but he's not someone you want to put in your starting lineup every week.

What does that mean under new offensive coordinator Joe Brady? That's tough to say, but there's suddenly a lot of mouths to feed in this offense. Christian McCaffrey is Thomas' biggest issue, as there's been just one team over the last four years who've had their top running back and top tight end combine for more than 198 targets. Keep in mind that's the max. It's rare for teams to have that duo combine for more than 180 targets. So, when you see that McCaffrey saw 141 targets last year, that's a big issue for someone like Thomas. You aren't going to take targets away from McCaffrey to feed him. During Teddy Bridgewater's stint as the starter for the Saints last year, Jared Cook finished with 7, 21, 41, and 37 yards, though he did score twice.

Lamb is coming from the Big-12 where the defenses are pretty horrendous, so the learning curve might be bigger than some expect. On top of that, he's going to have zero game experience with no preseason. It seems very likely that Lamb will start out as a slot-heavy receiver, which should help his transition into the faster pace of the NFL, and it's a role that Randall Cobb saw 83 targets in last year. Keep in mind that was Cobb's first year in the offense, so we should see Lamb reach or exceed that number. But temper expectations in fantasy, as he's clearly the third option this year behind Cooper and Gallup. He's someone who belongs in the WR4/5 conversation. If either of Cooper or Gallup were to miss time, Lamb would be a WR3 start with upside for more.

Despite playing just 13 games last year, Kirk saw 107 targets (132 target pace over 16 games). The issue is that Hopkins will get a large chunk of the pie, and Larry Fitzgerald didn't return to play another season to see just 50 targets. It'll be hard for anyone to correctly predict the target share among these receivers, but Kirk is an ascending talent who's entering year three of his young career. Knowing the Cardinals receivers combined for 368 targets last year, it's hard to see a scenario where Kirk sees more targets than he did last year, especially when you know they run a lot of 4WR sets (which cuts into the overall target pie). Kirk has also scored just three touchdowns in each of his first two seasons, so touchdowns aren't likely to make up for a lower target share. He's likely going to be somewhat of a hit-or-miss WR3/4 in 2020 with inconsistent targets.

Just one other team (Eagles) had their tight ends see over a 30.0 percent target share. Hayden Hurst is gone, which shifts those targets to the duo of Andrews and Boyle. While I anticipate some of them moving to the wide receivers, it's not a bad thing for Andrews supporters. I think many have forgotten just how hard it is for young tight ends to produce elite numbers, yet Andrews posted 852 yards and 10 touchdowns in his sophomore season on a team that threw the ball just 440 times. He's very good. With a slight bump in pass attempts for the team overall combined with the exit of Hurst, and we could see Andrews reach 120 targets this season. My issue with Andrews is that he's been a bit more inconsistent than the likes of Travis Kelce and George Kittle, so it takes a bit of projecting to see him reach that tier. Andrews played just 46 snaps per game in 2019, while those two averaged 60 snaps. For me, Andrews is in the tier directly behind them alongside Zach Ertz. If you can get him in the late-fourth or early-fifth round, I'm good with that. If you take him earlier, you're have to project 120 targets.

Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson are the only two other quarterbacks who can say that. In fact, Jones had four games where he tallied 28-plus fantasy points, including three games over 30 points, something Philip Rivers has never done in his career. It wasn't all pretty, though. Outside of those four explosion games, Jones was a train wreck, finishing with 14.7 or fewer fantasy points in the eight other games he started. His matchups where he exploded were against the Washington Football team, Bucs, Jets, and Lions. That's a far cry from his start to the season in 2020 where he'll open the season against the Steelers, Bears, and 49ers. You're going to find him on waiver wires before long. In fact, he has one of the toughest schedules in the league, though the start is just brutal. What his 2019 season reminded me of was 2018 Mitch Trubisky. Don't believe me? The stats highlighted in The Primer: Draft Day Edition back that up. Now to be fair, Jones is under a new head coach, though Jason Garrett may not be a better play caller than Pat Shurmur. On top of that, Jones never got the luxury to play with Saquon Barkley, Evan Engram, Sterling Shepard, Golden Tate, and Darius Slayton on the field at the same time. The upside is certainly there for Jones to take the leap into top-12 quarterback status, but the early schedule means you shouldn't draft him in 1QB leagues, unless you plan on platooning quarterbacks. In 2QB formats, he's the ideal solution, as he has job security, rushing upside, and his defense is horrendous.

At the same time, everyone on the team is learning a new offense, as Pat Shurmur has walked in as the offensive coordinator. Still, it'll be hard for him to overtake Courtland Sutton as the team's leader in targets. Jeudy can play many roles, including being the deep threat down the field, playing the possession-style role, or moving into the slot, which he did regularly at Alabama. Sutton isn't someone who'll move into the slot very often, which is a good thing for Jeudy, as Shurmur's slot receivers have done damage in the past. Again, the negative is that fellow rookie KJ Hamler is also a slot presence who's going to get some playing time. There's a path to Jeudy being a Terry McLaurin-like fantasy option this year, but his path to targets is not as easy. If Sutton stays on the field, Jeudy will be too inconsistent to trust on a weekly basis.

days ago","text":"Switching teams as a wide receiver this offseason seems... less than ideal. It does help, however, when there's a new quarterback on that team, as well as a coach you've played for in the past. Matt Rhule was the coach while Anderson was at Temple back in 2015. The issue is that Bridgewater's strengths don't really align with Anderson's. Bridgewater threw the ball 20-plus yards just 7.1 percent of the time last year, which ranked second lowest in the league. Anderson's skill set just doesn't align with Bridgewater's strengths as a passer, though they may try to force the issue after spending $20 million over two years on Anderson. Not having an offseason to build rapport makes me a bit more concerned, especially knowing we've seen Anderson's effort level best described as \"inconsistent\" on the field. It's tough to say he'll be a better fantasy option than he was in New York, only now his asking price is much lower.

While I don't disagree, there are plenty of wide receivers who've had bad quarterback play but managed to be useful. Samuel's 0.96 yards per route run in 2019 ranked dead last among the 157 wide receivers with at least 100 targets over the last five years. Heck, his teammate D.J. Moore was able to finish as the WR18. Based on the targets Samuel received and where they took place, he should have finished as the WR16. Look, I'm not saying Samuel is as bad as he was in 2019, but for him to become a reliable fantasy player, he'd have to overcome the fact that he's now the fourth-best target in the offense, behind McCaffrey, Moore, and Anderson. The Panthers also tried shopping Samuel this offseason, but ultimately held onto him. He's someone to look at during bye weeks when the Panthers are double-digit underdogs. Outside of that, you're just looking for an injury to him to become anything more than a WR5-type option.

Now another obstacle to cross. He'll have a new quarterback and a new head coach in 2020. The coach (Matt Rhule) also decided they needed to bring in Robby Anderson, a receiver who previously played under him, which could mean the targets get spread out a bit. The good news is that Bridgewater attempted a deep ball on just 7.1 percent of his pass attempts, which was the second-lowest rate in the NFL, and not an area where Moore operates. The talent is there for Moore to make a jump into WR1 status, but the situation doesn't seem ideal with virtually no offseason.

The issue is that Hopkins will get a large chunk of the pie, and Larry Fitzgerald didn't return to play another season to see just 50 targets. It'll be hard for anyone to correctly predict the target share among these receivers, but Kirk is an ascending talent who's entering year three of his young career. Knowing the Cardinals receivers combined for 368 targets last year, it's hard to see a scenario where Kirk sees more targets than he did last year, especially when you know they run a lot of 4WR sets (which cuts into the overall target pie). Kirk has also scored just three touchdowns in each of his first two seasons, so touchdowns aren't likely to make up for a lower target share. He's likely going to be somewhat of a hit-or-miss WR3/4 in 2020 with inconsistent targets.

Now going to a Cardinals team with Christian Kirk and Larry Fitzgerald, it's unlikely he reaches that mark. The odd offseason also hasn't given him a lot of time with new quarterback Kyler Murray. From reports, the first time the duo got together was at the end of June. Is that enough time to develop any sort of chemistry? Hopkins has played with a lot of bad quarterbacks in his time, though the only one who held him back from producing was Brock Osweiler, as Hopkins finished as the No. 29 wide receiver in 2016 despite seeing 151 targets. Murray's rookie season wasn't particularly efficient (both Fitzgerald and Kirk saw over 105 targets but outside the top-36 wide receivers), but we should expect growth in year two. There is a scenario where Hopkins is a rock-solid player but not a top-five fantasy receiver, however, given his history of producing with guys like Tom Savage, TJ Yates, and Brian Hoyer, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. Still, his targets will take a hit, making him a second-round pick rather than the first-round one he's been.

Here's my final line from Edwards' scouting report this offseason: If he gets an opportunity to play (was projected for 3rd/4th round), he can produce in the NFL. If they're planning on using Henry Ruggs in the slot, Edwards would make a good complement to Tyrell Williams on the perimeter. That would leave Hunter Renfrow out of the equation, as he's pretty much a slot-only receiver. So, again, if they're being truthful about Ruggs in the slot, Edwards should get some playing time immediately in 3WR sets, making him an intriguing pick in one of the last few rounds.

He's fast, sure. However, that's not his best attribute. He's slippery in the open field, takes great angles and utilizes his speed to get away from defenders. The best thing to do is get Ruggs the ball in his hands and let him create. Did you know that Jerry Jeudy had more than double the deep-ball receptions that Ruggs did while at Alabama? It's because Ruggs was used a lot on screens and reverses. Putting him in the slot will manufacture touches to get the ball in his hands and let him create. He shouldn't be pigeonholed to the slot, and I don't think he will be, but playing there is not a bad thing. Did you know slot targets are worth 10.8 percent more than perimeter targets? Seriously, I've done the research (can be read here). On top of that, Derek Carr had the lowest average depth of target among quarterbacks last year, so should love someone like Ruggs who creates after the catch. When a team spends a No. 12 overall pick on someone, they're going to find ways to get him the ball, so finding out the slot is his primary home makes you feel better about his potential in year one. I'd say his floor should be around 70 targets with a ceiling of 100 targets. He should also get some carries mixed in. Because of that combined with his one-play upside, he's worth WR3 consideration. Fortunately, you don't have to use a high pick on him, as he's going around the 11th-12th round. Even if you reach a round or two, I don't think you'll be disappointed if you have him on your roster as a WR4 with tremendous weekly upside.

","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"The Bears RB suffered a groin strain in his left leg on Aug. 26. Like hamstring injuries, the adductor muscles (along the inside of the thigh) are at an elevated risk of re-injury in the first couple of weeks back on the field. Per Ian Rapoport, Montgomery is expected to miss 2-4 weeks, suggesting he’s battling a grade II strain. The ideal recovery timeline for the severity of this injury is 4-6 weeks, so the reported 2-4 week timeline might be too optimistic. I am expecting Montgomery to miss at least the first week of the season, but if he is active in the first couple of games, he’s at risk of a setback.","source":"Fantasy

Knowing the schedule starts with the Cardinals, Jets, and Giants, he might get off to a hot start.

Any time a pass catcher has surgery on a foot or ankle in the same calendar year, you have to be concerned, as we've seen players continually struggle to produce. Kyle Shanahan has already come forward saying that Samuel will miss games, and that the only question is how many. This is a bit reminiscent of A.J. Green last year, where I kept telling people to take the discount as your WR3. Oddly enough, Samuel is being drafted in WR3 territory as the WR30 right now. There's no way I'll advise to make that mistake again, especially with a player who has such a limited sample size. He saw 81 targets last year. That's hardly \"can't miss\" material, anyway. If he falls into the double-digit rounds, he's not a bad gamble, but I wouldn't take him prior to then.

A Jones fracture describes a break in the 5th metatarsal, or the bone on the outside of the foot. He’ll undergo surgery to stabilize the broken bone and faces an 8-12 week recovery timeline. Recovery after this surgery can be tricky given the reduced blood supply to this region of the foot. As a result, some athletes recover more slowly, closer to the 12 week mark. Regardless, this injury is notable for being problematic given the torsional stress on the lateral side of the foot during sprinting and cutting with about 15-20% of athletes requiring a second revision procedure. Deebo has a chance to be ready for Week 1, but expecting any consistent production in the first month of the season is unrealistic. A recent study showed that there was a decrease in performance compared to pre-injury levels by just over 50% if the athlete returned to play prior to 10 weeks post-operatively. Update 8/20: Deebo Samuel is making progress and has resumed running in a straight line, but the real concern is his ability to cut while running at full speed. I would still expect a slower start to the season for Deebo as he acclimates back into football shape. Starting the season on PUP remains a possibility.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"19211":{"fantasyProsId":"19211","tier":11,"playerName":"Tee Higgins","position":"WIDERECEIVER","bye":"9","team":"BENGALS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-188,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":true,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"R","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-registration-mark"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"36.2"},{"name":"YDS","value":"492.1"},{"name":"TDS","value":"2.8"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"36.2"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"2.8"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"492.1"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0.7"},{"name":"YDS","value":"3.0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0.0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0.7"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0.0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"3.0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"101.7"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"101.7"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"102","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"6.0","priorTotalPoints":null,"priorAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalTargets":null,"priorAverageTargetsPerGame":null,"priorStatsByWeekNumber":{}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"207","positionRank":"78","bestRank":"138","worstRank":"340","avgRank":"217.0","stdDev":"30.5","adp":"189","vsAdp":"-18","rookieRanking":"12"},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":null,"smallPicLink":"https://images.fantasypros.com/images/players/nfl/19211/headshot/70x70.png","picLocation":"/images/players/TeeHiggins.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"2 days ago","text":"I believe the Bengals selected their eventual A.J.

He threw into tight coverage just 15.2 percent of the time, which was the seventh-lowest percentage in the league. In 2016, Taylor's mark was just 14.2 percent, the third-lowest mark in the league. Philip Rivers was at a much higher 17.1 percent last year. Williams is much more reliant on touchdowns to produce than Keenan Allen, which is why you should probably be fading the receiver who struggles with separation, especially now that he's playing with a quarterback who's not aggressive. Rivers has thrown 83 touchdowns in the 48 games since Williams came into the league. Meanwhile, Taylor has thrown 33 touchdown passes in his last 32 starts. Williams should be considered a WR4, at best.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Williams has been diagnosed with a “shoulder sprain” per Ian Rapoport, who also confirmed there is no fracture in Williams’ clavicle, typically an evaluation done for an AC joint injury. This injury can be problematic for wide receivers given that the joint is stressed with any overhead motions, which cause pain in the short term as well as a limited catch radius. Depending on the severity, Williams could miss Week 1 with less than three weeks until the opener. However, I wouldn’t expect this to cause lingering concerns throughout the season. The medical staff can use injections for pain control and additional taping and padding can be used to protect the joint.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},{"fantasyProsId":"19332","tier":15,"playerName":"K.J.

That's despite Philip Rivers throwing at least 28 touchdowns in five of them. He's a phenomenal route runner, but not the go-up-and-get-it receiver you'll fall in love with in the red zone. The move to Tyrod Taylor is likely going to be a tough one for Allen, as Taylor will lack pass attempts in comparison to Rivers. Even if we were to say the Chargers threw the ball 500 times (Taylor's career-high is 437 attempts), that's still a massive decrease from the 597 times they threw the ball in 2019. Taking away 97-plus targets will be felt throughout the depth chart, especially when you don't score a lot of touchdowns. It does help that the Chargers receiving corps is very top heavy with Allen and Mike Williams, though. Still, it's likely there'll be less than 250 targets between the Chargers receivers, so Allen isn't getting close to the 149 targets he got in 2019. Realistically, he's likely to be in the 110-120 target range. That's still enough for low-end WR2/high-end WR3 numbers, but don't expect the same Allen whose been relied upon as a borderline WR1 anymore.

It's more of a surprise to see him on the field than off the field. He's now missed 20 games over the last five seasons and appears set to start the year on the PUP list after undergoing Lisfranc surgery in mid-December. You'd think he'd be good to go by now, but with Jeffery, nothing is a given. You can't stash a player on your bench for six weeks in a year like this, though Jeffery does have appeal in best ball and leagues that'll allow you to place him on an IR slot. In his three years with the Eagles, Jeffery has managed to rack up 285 targets over 38 games, which amounts to 7.5 targets per game. That's led to WR2 or better numbers in 42.1 percent of games, which would've ranked as the No. 24 wide receiver in 2019. The Eagles don't have much wide receiver depth/talent, so once he comes back, he should walk back in to at least six targets per game and offer WR3 startability most weeks.

For Jeffery his surgery is to address a Lisfranc injury, which will significantly affect Jeffery in 2020. Unfortunately, it’s unknown specifically which type of surgery Jeffery had (as there are multiple varieties of the Lisfranc surgery), but it spells bad news for his performance in 2020. One specific study that looked at NFL players coming off Lisfranc surgery found that just over 80% of players did return to the field, but it took an average of 10 months. Jeffery’s surgery occurred in December, indicating it is extremely unlikely he is ready for Week 1. This same study also found that offensive players performed far worse than defensive players after surgery, and in general, all players in the study showed a 21% reduction in performance in their first season back from the injury. Players who have this surgery also tend to miss more games than players who do not in their 2nd and 3rd years after the injury. At 30 years old, Jeffery is a player who is extremely unlikely to return value in 2020.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},{"fantasyProsId":"18235","tier":12,"playerName":"J.J.

No, that does not mean he's ready to play football yet. I'm rooting for him, as it's a phenomenal story, but this is Haskins' team for the foreseeable future. Looking at his numbers over his rookie season, they weren't what you'd call good, though if you break them down by week, he was getting better. He threw four interceptions on his first 22 NFL passes. From that point, he threw seven touchdowns to three interceptions over his next 181 pass attempts. It's such a small sample size we have to go off, and on top of that, he has an entirely new coaching staff behind him. For a quarterback who was supposed to take time to develop, there are more changes than you'd prefer. The biggest issue is his offensive line that may not be able to give him more than a couple seconds after trading away Trent Williams. Outside of Terry McLaurin, he really doesn't have any proven commodities in the passing game, either. Generally, when a team has a new head coach, we see them have a big decrease in pass attempts unless they go from a defensive-minded coach to an offensive one. That's not the case here, meaning Haskins is unlikely to throw the ball a whole lot. Let's be real - you're not drafting him in 1QB leagues, and he's not someone you're aiming for in 2QB leagues, either.

We've never seen Watson without Hopkins, which certainly does raise some questions, but it also could provide an outlet for even more rushing yards for him. Watson maneuvers the pocket extremely well and buys himself time to find open receivers. Now without his safety blanket in Hopkins, we could see his rushing ceiling go up. Did you know he rushed for at least 32 yards in 9-of-15 games last year but never topped 47 rushing yards? That's odd, to say the least. The Texans defense will be as bad as it's ever been with Watson under center, which should mean even more dropbacks. The reason I'm still okay drafting Watson as a top-six quarterback: He's only thrown 26 touchdown passes in each of the last two years and has still been a top-12 type quarterback in 63.2 percent of his career games, which is the second-highest rate since 2000, behind only Patrick Mahomes. For context, there were just seven quarterbacks who topped 50 percent last year alone. Watson may not have the passing ceiling without Hopkins, but I'm expecting his rushing totals to make up for some of that, leaving him in the top-six quarterbacks.

He's now going outside the top-60 wide receivers. It certainly doesn't help that he had to have toe surgery and is now missing time with the team. It's nothing major but it does put him at a major disadvantage when A.J. Brown has overtaken the alpha role on the team. When a team has averaged just 440 pass attempts over the last two years, it's tough to find more than one player with value. The wide receivers have averaged 251 targets per season and a 57 percent target share. So, even if we get Tannehill to 480 pass attempts, we're looking at 274 targets for the receivers, and we know Brown is getting roughly 21-25 percent of the overall target share. It does help that Tajae Sharpe and his 35 targets are gone, so we're trying to find a way to divvy up 135-158 targets between Davis and Adam Humphries (and others).  That's enough for him to be reliable at times, especially if Tannehill can maintain some momentum from last year. We also can't forget that if Brown were to miss time, Davis would likely step into that 20-25 percent target share, and as a former first-round talent in a contract year, he could surprise.

Metcalf as my 1A receiver and Brown as my 1B. Loved them both, but Metcalf's landing spot moved him into the driver's seat. Maybe I underestimated just how much Brown could do without an elite quarterback. Despite not being a full-time player until Week 9 and seeing just 84 targets, Brown finished as the No. 21 wide receiver in his rookie season. There have been just 10 wide receivers over the last 10 years who've finished as a top-24 fantasy receiver while seeing fewer than 87 targets. Going back to when Ryan Tannehill started playing, Brown received a very stable 21 percent target share. That's not elite. Not bad, but not elite. Let's go from Week 9 through Week 17 when Brown moved to a full-time role. Brown's target share was 24 percent in that time, which ranked 10th among wide receivers. If we project Tannehill for 480-500 pass attempts, that'd amount to 115-120 targets. It is possible Brown's target share goes up but staying at 24 percent feels like it's repeatable. It's important to note that Brown averaged a ridiculous 8.9 yards after the catch last year, a number that isn't repeatable. You typically won't see even the best of the best receivers average more than 6.0 yards after the catch. If you move Brown down to the 5.5 range, he would've recorded 187 fewer yards and finished as the WR28. Then you must factor in Tannehill's ridiculous 7.7 percent touchdown rate regressing, so don't automatically assume that Brown's efficiency remains the same. He's still a phenomenal talent, but he needs to get the bump in pass attempts to take the next step. If I were guaranteed 500 pass attempts out of Tannehill, I'd draft him as a low-end WR1. It's best to be a bit cautious though and have some equity built in, making him a WR2 with serious upside.

Or how about he had no agility because his three-cone drill was bad? Or how about that J.J. Arcega-Whiteside, Mecole Hardman, Parris Campbell, and Andy Isabella went before him? Yeah, me too. Despite having a knee scope done during the last preseason, Metcalf managed to make it back for Week 1 where he racked up 89 yards on six targets. He wound up tallying nine games with more than 60 yards, which ranked 10th among wide receivers. That doesn't even count his playoff game against the Eagles where he broke the rookie record for receiving yards (160) in a playoff game. There was progression in his routes as the year went on, and he's been working out with Russell Wilson at his house this offseason. At 6-foot-4 and 229 pounds, the ceiling is endless with Metcalf, who has true WR1 potential as soon as this year. The biggest concern is that the Seahawks were looking into Antonio Brown, which tells me they may add another perimeter wide receiver.

days ago","text":"It was remarkable what McLaurin was able to do last year while playing on one of the worst teams in football. The disappointing part was that even though he saw 37.1 percent of his team's air yards (sixth in the NFL), he finished with just 93 targets. Knowing it's unlikely we see a big increase in pass attempts, it's hard for him to see an air yards number that is much higher. The reason we can be semi-optimistic with his targets is due to the lack of options around him. Kelvin Harmon and Paul Richardson are gone, along with the 86 targets they saw last year. In comes rookie Antonio Gandy-Golden, and veteran Dontrelle Inman, who was recently signed off the street. If we look at offensive coordinator Scott Turner's offense last year, you'll see it was very top-heavy when it came to the wide receivers, as D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel both hit 106-plus targets. I can't say there's anyone else on this Washington receiver depth chart that deserves more than 75 targets. This could be very similar to A.J. Brown, where we're looking at a player who might get a 25 percent target share in his offense, even if it is a low volume one. The difference is that McLaurin's quarterback hasn't ever posted all-time great numbers, and it's unreasonable to expect that. Still, McLaurin can likely live up to low-end WR2 expectations, though getting him as your WR3 is the ideal scenario.

But has the hype train gotten out of control? He's played four years of college and pro football, and here are his touch totals (most recent first): 30, 40, 33, and 0. He's been highly efficient on almost all of those touches, but at some point, you have to ask yourself why he's not getting more. Seriously, his efficiency last year was out of this world. Here are some stats for you from my 175 interesting facts from the 2019 football season article: \n-\tAmong wide receivers who've seen at least 30 targets, Mecole Hardman's 13.1 yards per target ranks as the third-highest mark among wide receivers over the last 10 years.\n-\tMecole Hardman averaged 2.77 PPR points per target in 2019, which ranked as the fourth-best mark among wide receivers over the last 10 years.\nPretty nuts, right? I'm not arguing his efficiency at all. His performance last year was very Tyreek Hill-esque, and I could see him breaking out similarly to Hill, \"if\" Hill wasn't on the field with him. It certainly helps that the Chiefs are taking him off special teams to focus on offense, as that's the same thing they did with Hill a few years ago. Drafting him as a WR4/5 could be worth the reward but understand that he might be the No. 5 option in the passing game behind Hill, Travis Kelce, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and Sammy Watkins.

If Lock can't get it done with the skill-position players around him now, he never will. The Broncos went out and signed Melvin Gordon in free agency, then drafted top wideout Jerry Jeudy in the first round, speedster KJ Hamler in the second round, then Lock's former teammate Albert Okwuegbunam in the fourth round. Pair them with Courtland Sutton, Phillip Lindsay, and Noah Fant, and you suddenly have one of the most talented rooms in the league. It's tough to judge anything we saw from Lock in his rookie season, as he was asked to start late in the season, and it was a different coordinator. What we do know is that Pat Shurmur is his new offensive coordinator, and he's produced some solid quarterback play in his time. The last time he was a coordinator was 2017 when he coached Case Keenum to a 68 percent completion rate, 22 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions. My concern with Lock is that this is still Vic Fangio's team, and their defense should be very good. If Fangio doesn't give full reigns to Shurmur, we're likely to see a defensive-minded, run-heavy offense, which would cripple Lock's fantasy appeal. The high end for Lock's pass attempts is likely in the 525-attempt range, which isn't great for a quarterback with limited mobility. He's a great target in 2QB leagues, but I wouldn't trust him as an every-week starter in 1QB formats.

Unfortunately, the injuries to his lower body added up as the year went on and his performances reflected that, as he topped 50 yards just once over the remaining 12 games he played. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman has said Brown's \"had a great offseason.\" Brown's schedule is great to start the year, too. In Weeks 2-5, he'll play against the Texans, Chiefs, Washington, and Bengals. The upside to Brown is a DeSean Jackson-like presence of someone who won't be a consistent WR1, but rather one you play as a WR2/3 who gives you \"boom\" potential on a weekly basis. However, if the Ravens don't up their pass attempts, it'll be hard figuring out when those booms will come. Relying on him as more than a WR3 this year would probably be a mistake, because there's not much evidence suggesting they'll throw the ball a lot more than they did in 2019.

days ago","text":"Over the last five years, I haven't scouted a wide receiver who was more pro-ready and well-rounded than Jeudy. With essentially no offseason, it's going to be difficult for him to walk in and develop instant chemistry with Drew Lock. At the same time, everyone on the team is learning a new offense, as Pat Shurmur has walked in as the offensive coordinator. Still, it'll be hard for him to overtake Courtland Sutton as the team's leader in targets. Jeudy can play many roles, including being the deep threat down the field, playing the possession-style role, or moving into the slot, which he did regularly at Alabama. Sutton isn't someone who'll move into the slot very often, which is a good thing for Jeudy, as Shurmur's slot receivers have done damage in the past. Again, the negative is that fellow rookie KJ Hamler is also a slot presence who's going to get some playing time. There's a path to Jeudy being a Terry McLaurin-like fantasy option this year, but his path to targets is not as easy. If Sutton stays on the field, Jeudy will be too inconsistent to trust on a weekly basis. He's still not a bad on to have on your bench as a WR4/5, because the talent is there.

He didn't finish as high as some thought (WR19), but it was a miracle he finished there if you were to go back and watch some of the passes he came down with. His 125 targets were the 15th most among wide receivers, though it's hard to see that continuing. He had zero competition for targets last year, which is why he saw over 50 percent of the ones that went to wide receivers. He'll now have to contend with first-round pick Jerry Jeudy, who's the most polished receiver who's come out in the last five years, and second-round pick KJ Hamler in the starting lineup. That's not to mention Melvin Gordon, who's an established pass-catcher out of the backfield. Sutton is clearly a star, but this offense is now littered with talented pass catchers. There were just two games all last year Sutton saw fewer than seven targets, but I think that number goes up this year. He was a middling WR2 last year with those high target totals, yet he's being drafted essentially where he finished last year, and that's despite the improved talent around him. If Sutton wants to finish better than a low-end WR2/high-end WR3, he's going to need double-digit touchdowns, and that's just not something I can predict given the talent around him.

I knew he did that very well, but that didn't mesh well with the risk averse Tom Brady. As for Newton, he's shown the willingness to target his wide receivers with little separation. Look no further than Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess. The last healthy season Newton played, he threw into tight coverage a whopping 20.5 percent of the time. By comparison, Brady only did that 15.2 percent of the time last year and 13.9 percent in 2018. Harry also dealt with some injuries during his rookie season, which prevented him from playing in a full-time role. Will he play over Mohamed Sanu in 2WR sets? Probably not just yet, but he could be a factor in the red zone, where he works best. He's a touchdown-dependent option, but one who won't see enough targets to be relevant if Julian Edelman is on the field. If Edelman misses time, Harry would receive a big boost.

Still, it was impressive for him to post 735 yards and three touchdowns on just 80 targets considering who was throwing to him. If the Steelers hadn't drafted Claypool, Washington would have sleeper appeal. Heck, he still does, but Claypool clouds his path. It does help that rookie minicamps were canceled and that there is no preseason action, so it's likely we see Washington get the reps out of the gate, and Roethlisberger has always talked good about him. Snagging Washington with a late-round pick might make sense, as you'll find out your answer in Week 1 against the Giants. If he plays the starter role and has a few big plays, you'll see many run to snag him off the waiver wire. On top of that, if Smith-Schuster or Johnson were to miss any time, Washington would likely be staring at six-plus targets per game.

days ago","text":"It's funny how I've become someone who's viewed as a \"Gallup hater\" in some circles. Let it be known that Gallup was one of my favorite receiver prospects in the 2018 draft class. But guys, he's not better than Amari Cooper. It's clear that Gallup benefits from Cooper's presence in the lineup and has fit into his field-stretching role rather nicely. Now, the question becomes: How much does CeeDee Lamb affect Gallup's target share? When Lamb was first drafted, I was concerned, but after sitting down and going through projections, I was still able to find 100-105 targets for him in the offense, which should net him a WR3 finish in fantasy. There are some risks taking him inside the top-30 because you're taking on some of the risk that Lamb doesn't eat into his target share a bit more, though it's a smaller risk knowing we've had a shortened offseason with no preseason action. I have Gallup as a back-end WR3 in fantasy with upside for a bit more if Lamb takes time to develop, which is not out of question. If Cooper missed time, Gallup would be my favorite receiver in the offense and a high-end WR2 start most weeks.

Cook took his game to another level in 2019, finishing as the No. 5 running back despite missing two games. Not only did he total 18-plus carries in eight games, but he also ranked third in yards per route run among running backs. With Stefon Diggs gone, we could see him highlighted even more in the passing game, though Justin Jefferson will eat some of them. Cook also led the league with 21 carries inside the five-yard-line. Health has always been a question mark with Cook, but when healthy, he's easily a top-10 back.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Recent news has surfaced that Dalvin Cook is planning to holdout unless he is able to sign a “reasonable” contract extension with the Vikings. It’s important for fantasy owners to know that how the Vikings choose to handle Cook’s contract could tell us a lot about how they view him from an injury risk perspective. In his 3-year NFL career, Cook has missed a total of 19 games. His injury history includes an ACL reconstruction procedure in his left knee from 2017 and now multiple shoulder surgeries on both shoulders. Most recently, Cook missed 3 games in 2019 because of shoulder injuries. He sprained the SC joint in his right shoulder earlier in the year then also suffered an injury consistent with a likely AC joint sprain on the left shoulder in Week 14. Cook had surgery to repair the labrum in his shoulder in 2014 (high school) and 2017 (college), so any additional shoulder injury exponentially increases his re-injury risk. Cook is fantastic when he’s on the field, but the shoulder injuries are piling up, and the risk is quite high.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"19521":{"fantasyProsId":"19521","tier":13,"playerName":"DeeJay Dallas","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"6","team":"SEAHAWKS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-998,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-40","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":true,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"R","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-registration-mark"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"30.1"},{"name":"YDS","value":"115.4"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0.7"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"30.1"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0.7"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"115.4"}}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"7.0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"59.7"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0.3"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"7.0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0.3"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"59.7"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"30.2"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"30.2"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"30","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"1.8","priorTotalPoints":null,"priorAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalTargets":null,"priorAverageTargetsPerGame":null,"priorStatsByWeekNumber":{}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"326","positionRank":"92","bestRank":"168","worstRank":"377","avgRank":"305.7","stdDev":"39.2","adp":"999","vsAdp":"673","rookieRanking":"41"},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":null,"smallPicLink":"https://images.fantasypros.com/images/players/nfl/19521/headshot/70x70.png","picLocation":"/images/players/DeeJayDallas.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"ROOKIE","text":"Normally 4th round RB rookies aren’t very interesting for fantasy.

Do they go with more of a timeshare under Gruden? it's possible, but he should still offer low-end RB1 value.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"BUST","text":"Fournette surprised the world last year (and himself?) with an absolutely incredible receiving year. Having never surpassed 36 receptions in a season, he put up a staggering 76 catches in a true 'last man standing' situation in Jacksonville. Fournette is talented, but not a natural pass catcher, and the Jags brought in pass-catching aficionado, Chris Thompson, to join the newly-minted Jay Gruden. Fournette trade rumors abound and even if he's not moved, this will be his final season in Jacksonville.

That's incredible opportunity. Unfortunately, he averaged just 2.0 yards of separation when targeted, which was the lowest number in football. Williams needs a quarterback who's willing to throw it into tight coverage to succeed. We haven't seen Tyrod Taylor play in a little bit, but the last season he was a starter was in 2017. He threw into tight coverage just 15.2 percent of the time, which was the seventh-lowest percentage in the league. In 2016, Taylor's mark was just 14.2 percent, the third-lowest mark in the league. Philip Rivers was at a much higher 17.1 percent last year. Williams is much more reliant on touchdowns to produce than Keenan Allen, which is why you should probably be fading the receiver who struggles with separation, especially now that he's playing with a quarterback who's not aggressive. Rivers has thrown 83 touchdowns in the 48 games since Williams came into the league. Meanwhile, Taylor has thrown 33 touchdown passes in his last 32 starts. Williams should be considered a WR4, at best.

This injury can be problematic for wide receivers given that the joint is stressed with any overhead motions, which cause pain in the short term as well as a limited catch radius. Depending on the severity, Williams could miss Week 1 with less than three weeks until the opener. However, I wouldn’t expect this to cause lingering concerns throughout the season. The medical staff can use injections for pain control and additional taping and padding can be used to protect the joint.","source":"Fantasy

days ago","text":"If we were replaying the 2019 season, Jackson would be the No. 2 pick in fantasy leagues, and it wouldn't be a reach. He was behind only Christian McCaffrey in value based drafting score. We talk all the time about regression when it comes to quarterbacks with a high touchdown rate, and Jackson is no different after posting a ridiculous 9.0 percent touchdown rate in 2019. That's going to come down. Lowering that mark to 5.0 percent (which is still above average), he would've thrown 20 touchdowns instead of the 36 that he did. However, something to help offset that is his rushing touchdown output. Based on where his carries took place last year, Jackson should've scored closer to 12 rushing touchdowns rather than the seven that he did. The downside to Jackson is that he's a bit thinner than you'd like as a mobile quarterback. While it's tough to get a clean hit on him, we have a history of mobile quarterbacks not withstanding a lot of hits. When you invest a second- or third-round pick on a quarterback, you need him on the field. If Jackson were a lock to play all 16 games, he'd be my QB1 and well worth a second-round pick.

He's now going outside the top-60 wide receivers. It certainly doesn't help that he had to have toe surgery and is now missing time with the team. It's nothing major but it does put him at a major disadvantage when A.J. Brown has overtaken the alpha role on the team. When a team has averaged just 440 pass attempts over the last two years, it's tough to find more than one player with value. The wide receivers have averaged 251 targets per season and a 57 percent target share. So, even if we get Tannehill to 480 pass attempts, we're looking at 274 targets for the receivers, and we know Brown is getting roughly 21-25 percent of the overall target share. It does help that Tajae Sharpe and his 35 targets are gone, so we're trying to find a way to divvy up 135-158 targets between Davis and Adam Humphries (and others).  That's enough for him to be reliable at times, especially if Tannehill can maintain some momentum from last year. We also can't forget that if Brown were to miss time, Davis would likely step into that 20-25 percent target share, and as a former first-round talent in a contract year, he could surprise. He has a little bit of a DeVante Parker feel to him, because make no mistake about it, Davis is a good football player. I like him as a late-round bench stash.

There were a lot of times he was open for what would've been a long gain/touchdown, but Andy Dalton simply missed him. Insert Joe Burrow, who completed 76.3 percent of his passes at LSU last year, including feather-like touch on his deep ball. Ross saw five-plus targets in 6-of-8 games last year, so it's clear that Zac Taylor felt he could make a difference. With both Green and Boyd healthy, Ross won't be seeing that consistent of targets, but should either of them miss time, Ross would be a plug-and-play upside option.

days ago","text":"It was quite miraculous what Minshew accomplished in 2020, especially when you factor in the lack of draft capital (sixth-round pick) they used to acquire him. Don't understand just how good he was? Put his numbers up next to Kyler Murray's. Minshew averaged more yards and passing touchdowns, while having fewer interceptions per game. And keep in mind that Minshew didn't even start two of the games included in that sample. Am I going to say that he should be drafted like Murray? No. However, he is being undervalued by those in 2QB leagues. The average quarterback rushes for a touchdown every 96.2 yards rushing. Had Minshew scored three rushing touchdowns (instead of the zero that he did) on 344 rushing yards, he would've finished as the No. 14 fantasy quarterback... in his rookie season... as a sixth-round pick. The Jaguars defense is as bad as ever, so we'll see plenty of pass attempts out of him. It should also be noted that Jay Gruden (his new coordinator) has produced top-14 quarterbacks in 6-of-9 years, and the years he didn't, there were injuries and/or multiple quarterbacks playing. Minshew has zero competition and can potentially be a Jameis Winston-lite in 2020. He's the perfect target in 2QB leagues and will be streamable quite a bit in 1QB leagues.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"SLEEPER","text":"Let's be honest, this is all about his rushing prowess. Minshew flashed a decent arm at times last year as he developed a great connection with DJ Chark, but his value came from a solid rushing baseline. 17 designed runs, 50 scrambles, and 350+ rushing yards means that if he can put the ball into the end zone at least once you'll be okay. The job is his, and Chark, Westbrook, Thompson and newly drafted Shenault offer some upside in the new Jay Gruden offense.

It should be common knowledge that Ryan Pace's job as the general manager was tied to Trubisky. Both his and Matt Nagy's jobs are likely on the line here. When you add in the rushing upside that Trubisky presents, as well as the equity they used to draft him, he might be under center in Week 1, though he'd be on a short leash. With an opening schedule against the Lions, Giants, Falcons, Colts, Buccaneers, and Panthers, whoever is under center should get off to a hot start. Want to hear something crazy? On average, it took 18.6 fantasy points to finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2019. Trubisky hit that mark as many times as Kyler Murray and Tom Brady did. As a fantasy player, you want Trubisky to win the job, as he makes for a better streamer. There's been just two games over the last three years where Foles has scored more than 17.8 fantasy points. Let's be real - you aren't drafting either of these guys in 1QB leagues, but if you want to select both of them to be your QB2/QB3 in 2QB leagues, I actually like that strategy, especially with that early-season schedule.

His completion percentage dropped 4.4 points, yards per attempt dropped 0.5 yards, he threw five less touchdowns, and threw seven more interceptions. Wait, I thought Odell Beckham was supposed to help? It's clear that Freddie Kitchens hurt all players involved, as even Nick Chubb was extremely inefficient in the red zone, totaling negative 16 yards on nine carries inside the five-yard-line. Let's just erase that season, shall we? Kevin Stefanski will be the new head coach and play caller. Do we have a lot to go off? Not really. What we do know is that they added two offensive linemen who'll make a difference at the most important positions, as well as add a pass-catching tight end. It seems they would like to replicate what the Vikings did last year under Stefanski, which would be brutal for Mayfield's outlook, as Kirk Cousins threw the ball just 444 times. Mayfield has some mobility but not enough to overcome that low of volume through the air. But knowing that's possible, we know Mayfield could have a lower floor than most would like to admit. He should be treated as an excellent QB2 in Superflex/2QB formats, while being looked at as a streamer in standard leagues.

days ago","text":"We've already heard Fitzpatrick say that he's \"just a placeholder\" for Tagovailoa, but it wouldn't be wise to throw a rookie quarterback coming off hip surgery to the wolves with no game experience in Week 1. The Dolphins bye isn't until Week 11, which is a long time for Tagovailoa to be waiting in the wings. You want to find a soft spot in their schedule to start him, but looking at their schedule, there's only a small window in Weeks 3 against the Jaguars, but that's proceeded by games against the Seahawks, 49ers, Broncos, and Chargers. In all honesty, Week 9 against the Cardinals might make the most sense, as they also get the Jets in Week 10, then their bye week. Whatever the case, Tagovailoa will start at some point. Fitzpatrick was a great streamer in 2019. In fact, he's been a great streamer the last three years. He's started just 23 games in that stretch but has posted QB1-type numbers in 14 of them, or 60.9 percent. Did you know that just seven quarterbacks topped 50 percent in 2019? As mentioned, though, the Dolphins don't have a great start to their schedule. Like most scenarios that have multiple quarterbacks, this is a situation to attack in 2QB/Superflex leagues, as you can snag both of them late in your draft and simply start the one who's under center. Fitzpatrick already showed he can make it work with the players around him, while Tagovailoa was once considered the No. 1 pick over Joe Burrow.

days ago","text":"Trusting a rookie quarterback in fantasy? Nonsense. Now? After we practically had no offseason? It sounds crazy, and it probably is. However, I don't know if I've seen a quarterback with Burrow's confidence and swag come into the league in a long time. He's also walking into a situation where he has one of the best wide receiver depth charts in the league (when healthy). The offense that Zac Taylor ran last year presented plenty of opportunity, as Andy Dalton finished with the 12th most expected fantasy points despite missing three full games. He threw the ball at least 36 times in 11-of-13 games, including three games with 50-plus attempts. The offensive line is a problem, though it helps he'll get last year's first-round pick Jonah Williams back at left tackle. While the pass attempts and talent at wide receiver are great, what should attract you to Burrow is his willingness to run with the ball. Sure, he broke records as a passer at LSU, but he also rushed for nearly 800 yards and 12 touchdowns over the last two years. That adds breakout potential to a quarterback, so when you combine that with his arm talent, he makes for an ideal QB2 in fantasy. The Bengals defense is in a complete rebuild mode, and while they've added talent this offseason, it'll take time for them to come together. They allowed 26.2 points per game last year (8th most), so if they continue to struggle, Burrow could become 2020's version of Jameis Winston.

He's completed 67.5 percent of his passes, and he has a 2.10:1 touchdown to interception ratio. Despite all that, he's been a top-12 type quarterback in fantasy just 28.0 percent of the time since joining the 49ers. How is that? He plays for Kyle Shanahan and has averaged just 29.7 pass attempts per game. When you do that to a strictly pocket passer, it crushes his fantasy upside. It's unlikely that changes in 2020, especially when you consider he'll be without his No. 1 receiver for a while, as Deebo Samuel recovers from broken foot surgery. It's worth noting that two of his four QB1 performances in 2019 were against the Cardinals, the team he'll play in Week 1. Again, he'll be without Samuel, but George Kittle might go nuclear.

My issue with Cobb is... what's the upside? Cole Beasley-type numbers from last year? He even finished as the No. 34 wide receiver, but was any fantasy owner excited to put him in their lineup? Maybe during bye weeks but that's about it. He's just a WR5-type option to me, and one who lacks upside.

There are some risks taking him inside the top-30 because you're taking on some of the risk that Lamb doesn't eat into his target share a bit more, though it's a smaller risk knowing we've had a shortened offseason with no preseason action.

On top of that, he's going to have zero game experience with no preseason. It seems very likely that Lamb will start out as a slot-heavy receiver, which should help his transition into the faster pace of the NFL, and it's a role that Randall Cobb saw 83 targets in last year.

Did you know Michael Gallup averaged more targets per game than Cooper last year? Cooper's injury may have played into that but it didn't stop him from being one of the best in the league. Based on the number of his targets and where they took place on the field, Cooper should've finished as the No. 23 wide receiver, and not the No. 9 receiver he did. In fact, he was the only receiver in the league who scored 20-plus more fantasy points than he was expected to in both the red zone and outside the red zone. The addition of CeeDee Lamb isn't going to make getting targets any easier for Cooper, who's now seen 195 targets in 25 games with the Cowboys. Because he's not getting the gaudy numbers that some are, Cooper should be considered a semi-volatile WR2 in fantasy who has more WR1 upside than most on a weekly basis. If Cooper were to get 150 targets, I have zero doubts that he'd finish as a top-three receiver, but as we've seen, that just doesn't happen.

That was despite them having their bye in Week 5, as well as him not being a true starter until Week 3. He was extremely good his rookie year. He's coming off a torn ACL, which isn't an injury that's as detrimental as it used to be, but it may be tough for him to return as the same player in a brand-new offense. The Dolphins defense improved greatly, their run game should be much better, and they'll eventually transition to a rookie quarterback. These are all question marks, but fortunately, Williams is being drafted outside the top 60 wide receivers, similar to the way DeVante Parker was last year. Given their current prices (Williams WR61, Parker WR22), Williams seems like a much better value than Parker this year. Knowing that Allen Hurns and Albert Wilson have opted out, there are plenty of targets up for grabs, making Williams a solid WR4/5 on fantasy teams that you can spot-start depending on matchups.

Typically, recovery after an ACL surgery takes about 9 months at a minimum, but the vast majority of athletes don’t reach peak performance until 11-12 months after surgery. Given that Williams tore his ACL in November, it’s realistic to expect a slower first month of the season. Worth noting, Williams could also be negatively affected by COVID-19 if there is a shortened training camp or preseason.

days ago","text":"It's about time, right? I remember last year on the podcast talking about Parker, saying there's a clear avenue for him to see 100-plus targets and that if Fitzpatrick was starting, I wanted him on my roster. Here we are 128 targets and a No. 7 wide receiver finish later. Fun fact: Parker and Michael Thomas were the only two receivers who posted at least 55 yards in 13 games last year. You were able to get Parker outside the top 60 wide receivers last year, something that isn't happening this time around. His current draft position is right around WR20-22, so you're receiving a discount from last year's production, and rightfully so. Preston Williams is back from his ACL injury, which isn't great news for Parker, who was the No. 34 wide receiver through nine weeks with Williams in the lineup. That was really solid for him considering where he was drafted, but once Williams left, Parker exploded and finished as the No. 2 wide receiver the remainder of the season. Part of the reason that happened was due to Ryan Fitzpatrick's willingness to target him relentlessly, as he averaged 9.5 targets per game over that span. To be fair, Williams is coming back, but both Allen Hurns and Albert Wilson have opted out of the season, clearing up 110 targets from last year. Knowing Fitzpatrick is starting the season under center helps me feel more confident in Parker, but there's certainly hesitation in drafting him this year as the Dolphins defense is going to be much better, which will result in fewer pass attempts, and that they'll be moving to a rookie quarterback at some point. I think he's best viewed as a stable WR3 who comes with top-12 upside. If I knew Fitzpatrick would start all year, he'd be a WR2.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"BUST","text":"Parker - Parker looked like a player that had finally taken the step. His route tree still isn’t amazing, but he thrives on nine routes and winning contested catches. If Tua takes the job Week 1, will a rookie QB be willing to throw those passes at a high volume? There was a large target increase after Preston Williams tore his ACL. If Williams is back, will he re-establish himself?

They said the plan is for Pittman to be the \"X\" receiver in the offense, which should present value with someone like Philip Rivers, who has zero issue throwing into tight coverage, especially when his receiver is 6-foot-4 and 223 pounds. This is your reminder that Mike Williams is 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, while Vincent Jackson was 6-foot-5 and 230 pounds. These are wide receivers that Rivers targeted relentlessly. Mike Williams averaged just 2.0 yards of separation at target last year, the second-worst mark in football. Can Pittman make it into the starting lineup opening day? If so, Rivers could fall in love with his size, particularly in the red zone. He's worth a pick with one of your last few selections, as he's a dark horse to lead the team in receiving touchdowns.

Here's the crazy part about Brown last year: He hit WR3 or better numbers in 73.3 percent of his games, which ranked 11th in the league. He only hit WR2 or better numbers in 26.7 percent of his games, which ranked 51st in the league. Now start removing targets to get Diggs his, and we suddenly lose some of that WR3 floor that he had. He is a good football player who just won't get enough targets to start on a consistent basis. Now, if Diggs were to miss any time, we could go back to playing him as a low-end WR2/high-end WR3.

days ago","text":"Going from Kirk Cousins to Josh Allen isn't going to be a highlight of Diggs' career, as Cousins has continually been one of the better deep-ball passers, while Allen was among the worst in 2019. Diggs actually led the league in yardage on passes that traveled over 20 yards in the air last year. The Bills are still a run-first team that has a top-tier defense, so it's hard to expect a big jump in pass attempts. They targeted their wide receivers 310 times last year, which was a lot for a team that threw the ball just 513 times. The 60.4 percent target share was the fourth-highest mark in the league. So, again, it's tough to say there will be more to go around. Knowing that John Brown was fantastic last year (115 targets), as was Cole Beasley (104 targets), it's tough to take targets away from them, but we have to start taking them from someone because you don't trade for someone like Diggs and not target him. Still, giving him even 115 targets might be too generous, as it'd completely crush the value of Brown, who already has experience with the quarterback/offense. Realistically, I have Diggs down for 111 targets in my projections. When tied to Allen's inconsistencies, that is a WR3 in fantasy who can get into WR2 territory at year's end, similarly to the way Brown did last year. Diggs is probably a top-eight wide receiver in the league, but you need to targets to move up the boards in fantasy football. I'd be happy landing him as my WR3, but that's about it.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"BUST","text":"Diggs is a great WR. Josh Allen is not Kirk Cousins when it comes to accuracy.

But has the hype train gotten out of control? He's played four years of college and pro football, and here are his touch totals (most recent first): 30, 40, 33, and 0. He's been highly efficient on almost all of those touches, but at some point, you have to ask yourself why he's not getting more. Seriously, his efficiency last year was out of this world. Here are some stats for you from my 175 interesting facts from the 2019 football season article: \n-\tAmong wide receivers who've seen at least 30 targets, Mecole Hardman's 13.1 yards per target ranks as the third-highest mark among wide receivers over the last 10 years.\n-\tMecole Hardman averaged 2.77 PPR points per target in 2019, which ranked as the fourth-best mark among wide receivers over the last 10 years.\nPretty nuts, right? I'm not arguing his efficiency at all. His performance last year was very Tyreek Hill-esque, and I could see him breaking out similarly to Hill, \"if\" Hill wasn't on the field with him. It certainly helps that the Chiefs are taking him off special teams to focus on offense, as that's the same thing they did with Hill a few years ago. Drafting him as a WR4/5 could be worth the reward but understand that he might be the No. 5 option in the passing game behind Hill, Travis Kelce, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and Sammy Watkins. For a team that hasn't thrown the ball more than 583 times in Andy Reid's entire time in Kansas City, that directly impacts Hardman, even if he is uber efficient. If he starts playing more snaps than Watkins, that's when you'll see me completely buy in.

Sure, he was bad in 2019, but he looked like the player we thought he'd be once they got to the playoffs, as he compiled 14 receptions for 288 yards and a touchdown on 18 targets in their three playoff games.

In my Boom, Bust, and Everything In Between series, I highlighted the fact that he's been a WR2 or better in just 44.1 percent of his career games, while someone like Julio Jones has posted WR1 numbers in 42.4 percent of his games. Hill averaged just 7.4 targets per game last year, a number that will need to come up for him to be a more consistent fantasy option. Can it happen? Absolutely. The addition of Clyde Edwards-Helaire will not help that, nor will the supposed increase in Mecole Hardman offensive snaps. There were just two games in 2019 where Hill saw double-digit targets, which again, limits his consistency. By comparison, Davante Adams has averaged 11.0 targets per game over the last two years while Julio Jones saw 10-plus targets in 7-of-15 games in 2019. If you want to draft Hill as your WR1, I have no issue with it, but understand that you'll need to balance your roster throughout the remainder of the draft.

He's the slot receiver in the offense when they go three-wide, and he's the safety valve for Josh Allen. With that being said, many more plays will be designed to the perimeter in order to get the ball into Digg's hands. That will cap the number of targets Beasley sees, which was at a tremendous 104 last year. Even without Diggs on the roster last year, Beasley produced just two games with more than 14.3 half PPR points, so it's not like you were winning weeks because of him. He was a fine streamer during bye weeks as someone who wouldn't crush your lineup. Lowering expectations to around 80-85 targets, Beasley's floor has been lowered and there will be better options to choose during bye weeks in 2020.

days ago","text":"Not many realize the Texans tight ends saw a very respectable 19.1 percent target share in 2019, and that was with DeAndre Hopkins on the roster. Knowing the defense is likely taking another step back, we could see increased pass attempts, and a higher target total available. The issue is that Fells and Akins shared the role, though not many realize it was Akins who led them with 55 targets, 36 receptions, and 418 yards. The only thing Fells beat him in was touchdowns, as his seven trumped Akins' two. Based on what we saw out of Akins last year, we should expect the third-year player to take a step forward in 2020, and with a little touchdown luck, he might be an underrated fantasy option. You don't need to draft him in standard 1TE leagues, but you can consider him a streamer in good matchups if my projections hold true.

And lastly, he was at just 18.8 percent in 2017, the ninth-lowest mark. Meanwhile, he'll give you big games here and there while not completely tanking your team.

While there is no confirmation of the exact injury sustained, Jones had his left ankle get caught underneath a defender while being tackled, a mechanism that usually results in either a high ankle sprain or a fractured fibula (lower leg bone) or both. Immediately after the play, Jones struggled to put any weight on his leg, causing concern for a fracture. There has been no indication of surgery for Jones this offseason, however. Given the lack of clarity regarding the situation, it’s difficult to speak to Jones’ 2020 injury risk.

A target on your own 10-yard line isn't worth as much as a target on the opponent's 20-yard line, etc. Each of the tight ends who finished top-12 in opportunity finished top-13 at year's end, so it's clearly something to look for. Based on Hockenson's pace over 16 games, he would've been the No. 12 tight end in opportunity. Now going into his second season, we should see his role grow. Hockenson was one of the least efficient players in all of football last year, and even going over the last 10 years, his 54.2 percent catch-rate ranked 331st among 357 tight ends who've seen at least 30 targets. There's only room for improvement, so if you're looking for a potential late-round tight end, he has more opportunity than most realize.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Hockenson’s rookie campaign ended on Thanksgiving after he suffered a significant high ankle sprain on his right leg. These injuries take several months to heal and sometimes require surgery to stabilize the ligaments that connect the two lower leg bones together. There are reports that Hockenson was on a scooter (non-weight bearing) in late December, suggesting it’s possible he underwent surgery on the ankle. Unfortunately, the Lions aren’t an organization that gives much detail regarding their players’ injuries, so I can’t confirm whether or not Hockenson required surgery. Regardless, he can be expected to be ready about 6-9 months after the injury. Reports around the Lions’ camp suggest Hockenson is still not back to 100%, further suggesting he underwent surgery after his severe high ankle injury. Fantasy gamers will likely want to temper expectations for Hockenson early in the season.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"13969":{"fantasyProsId":"13969","tier":13,"playerName":"Nelson Agholor","position":"WIDERECEIVER","bye":"6","team":"RAIDERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-371,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-40","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":11,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"39"},{"name":"YDS","value":"363"},{"name":"TDS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"39"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"3"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"363"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"2"},{"name":"YDS","value":"7"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"2"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"7"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"94.00000000000001"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"94.00000000000001"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"18.9"},{"name":"YDS","value":"207.3"},{"name":"TDS","value":"1.1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"18.9"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"1.1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"207.3"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"1.4"},{"name":"YDS","value":"13.3"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0.0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"1.4"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0.0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"13.3"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"46.7"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"46.7"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"47","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"2.7","priorTotalPoints":"94","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"8.5","priorTotalTargets":"69","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"6.3","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"25"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"25"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"23"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"23"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"294","positionRank":"100","bestRank":"173","worstRank":"410","avgRank":"273.4","stdDev":"41.0","adp":"372","vsAdp":"78","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/fk3xbu2ah4c06vla1bhy","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/fk3xbu2ah4c06vla1bhy","picLocation":"/images/players/NelsonAgholor.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"11 weeks ago","text":"Agholor has never made the most of his opportunities, struggling with drops throughout his five-year career.

Despite having a knee scope done during the last preseason, Metcalf managed to make it back for Week 1 where he racked up 89 yards on six targets. He wound up tallying nine games with more than 60 yards, which ranked 10th among wide receivers. That doesn't even count his playoff game against the Eagles where he broke the rookie record for receiving yards (160) in a playoff game. There was progression in his routes as the year went on, and he's been working out with Russell Wilson at his house this offseason. At 6-foot-4 and 229 pounds, the ceiling is endless with Metcalf, who has true WR1 potential as soon as this year. The biggest concern is that the Seahawks were looking into Antonio Brown, which tells me they may add another perimeter wide receiver. It would directly impact his target upside if that were to happen, and not as much Tyler Lockett. Because of that, Lockett is the safer pick this year, though it's Metcalf who has the higher ceiling.

Combining Lockett's games under Brian Schottenheimer prior to the shin injury, he's totaled 116 receptions for 1,732 yards and 16 touchdowns over a span of 25 games. That's pretty dang good. Knowing that I'm projecting a rise in pass attempts for the Seahawks overall, Lockett should see 110-plus targets as long as he's healthy, a number that goes very far with Russell Wilson as his quarterback. Seriously, stop talking about regression when it comes to Wilson's receivers. First it was Doug Baldwin. Regression never really happened. Then there was Lockett. Next, it'll be Metcalf. Lockett is perfectly fine as your WR2. He's the safer of the Seahawks receivers because his role is locked in.

The Jets have what I deemed the toughest schedule in the league for perimeter wide receivers, so even if we see Perriman get the targets, he's unlikely to be efficient with them. He closed the 2019 season with 25 receptions for 506 yards and five touchdowns over his last five games, which will have some intrigued, but my guess is that you'll drop Perriman for a hot waiver wire pickup, as Gase's offense isn't Bruce Arians' and Sam Darnold isn't Jameis Winston. There will be weeks where Perriman snags a deep ball and pays off, but those are the types of players you can find on the waiver wire all the time.

Not that they're the same player, but rather people didn't know how good they were until they looked past the school they played for. Mims is a possession-style receiver who can stretch the field, as evidenced by his 4.38-second 40-yard dash he ran at the Combine. He should become a favorite of Sam Darnold in the red zone, as he plucks the ball out of the air with his strong mitts. He'll be battling with Breshad Perriman for targets on the perimeter, while Jamison Crowder remains the safety valve in the slot. Robby Anderson did see 96 targets last year while Demaryius Thomas saw 58 of them (in 11 games), so there's room for a fantasy producer. The issue is that Mims is a rookie who hasn't seen any preseason action and hasn't had much time to be around the team. The same can be said for Perriman, so there's a route to immediate production with Mims, though Adam Gase has not been friendly to perimeter wide receivers. Over the last four years, his top receivers were Jarvis Landry (twice), Danny Amendola, and Jamison Crowder... all slot receivers. It's best to be cautious with rookie wide receivers, especially this year, even if I like who Mims is as a player. Selecting him in one of the final rounds makes sense, as you'll find out what you have over the first two weeks and decide whether you want to cut bait or stick with him.

Crowder was one of them. He was No. 16, actually. Did you know he's the only one who didn't finish as a top-26 wide receiver? His No. 31 finish was better than most would anticipate, though it was uglier than you'd like it to be. In fact, he produced WR3 or better numbers just 43.8 percent of the time, which ranked 42nd among wide receivers. He also scored fewer than 8.0 PPR points in 43.8 percent of his games. With that being said, he's the only receiver returning to the starting lineup for Sam Darnold. Both Breshad Perriman and Denzel Mims are new faces who are going to require time to learn the new offense and develop chemistry with Darnold. Crowder's targets aren't likely to go anywhere. In fact, they might actually go up, which is kind of crazy. Crowder doesn't offer top-15 wide receiver upside, but he does present some stability as a mix-and-match WR3/4 type who presents a solid floor in a pinch. His current ADP of WR49 allows you to get him as your WR5 in some situations, which is fine if you need to add some balance to your high-upside team.

Michael Thomas is going to get a massive chunk of the targets, and rightfully so. You don't want to start taking targets away from Alvin Kamara, either. And judging how efficient Jared Cook was last year, you'd be hard pressed to take away any of his 65 targets from last year. So, where do the targets for Sanders come from? He's now 33 years old and is clearly towards the end of his career. This was a better move from a football standpoint than a fantasy one. Yes, he's getting a big upgrade at quarterback, but you need targets to produce. There was just one game last year where a Saints receiver not named Michael Thomas saw more than six targets.

It's tough to be a reliable fantasy option when that's the case. Not only that, but the Jets are still under Adam Gase, which means there won't be many plays per game (he's been under 59 plays per game in each of the last two seasons). The Jets have what I deemed the toughest schedule in the league for perimeter wide receivers, so even if we see Perriman get the targets, he's unlikely to be efficient with them. He closed the 2019 season with 25 receptions for 506 yards and five touchdowns over his last five games, which will have some intrigued, but my guess is that you'll drop Perriman for a hot waiver wire pickup, as Gase's offense isn't Bruce Arians' and Sam Darnold isn't Jameis Winston. There will be weeks where Perriman snags a deep ball and pays off, but those are the types of players you can find on the waiver wire all the time. I just don't see him getting more than 5-6 targets per game.

While he's still stuck in Gase's offense, the offensive line was upgraded quite a bit this offseason, which should allow Bell more room to work. Even if he repeated his 2019 performance, that's RB2 production. There were just 11 running backs who produced RB2 or better numbers more often than him. Sure, he didn't have a ton of weekly upside, but he was safe. Now coming off the board outside the top three rounds, Bell is a value play.

He tore the patellar tendon in his right knee in 2018 then tore the Achilles tendon in his left leg in Week 6 of 2019. He’s had two major tendon repair surgeries over the past two years, something that spells bad news for Big Montana in 2020. Rehab after these two surgeries is long and cumbersome, with most research supporting a minimum of one year of rehab prior to returning to the field at performance levels comparable to pre-injury levels. The problem with these surgeries is the athlete’s power and explosiveness is negatively affected, usually resulting in worse performance on the field especially in year one.

days ago","text":"The end of an era. Crazy to write Brady's name under the Bucs, but hey, this might be the least crazy thing about 2020. He's going from Julian Edelman and Mohamed Sanu to Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. That should help his shockingly low 6.6 yards per attempt from 2019. Not only that, but 2019 was the first time in Brady's career where he didn't have a touchdown percentage of 4.0 or above. It was also the first time since 2004 where he completed less than 61 percent of his passes. Will the upgrade in receivers help him get back on track, or are we at the end for the greatest of all-time? The Patriots offensive line was not particularly good last year, so when you combined that with Brady's inability to move at all, you get bad numbers. The Bucs offensive line hasn't been good over the last few years, though they were slightly better in 2019, and they did draft tackle Tristan Wirfs in the first round, highlighting the fact that they know Brady needs protection. They don't have a James White/Julian Edelman on the roster to be his safety valve, though I suspect Godwin will become that player to him. Will the pass attempts drop off from Jameis Winston? Probably, but know that Bruce Arians has not fallen out of the top 20 in pass attempts since back in 2010. His teams have now been top-five in each of his last three years as a coach. Knowing they don't have a running back like Saquon Barkley on the roster, we should expect 580-plus pass attempts, and if you look at the receivers on the roster, and what their career averages are when it comes to yards per target, yards per reception, touchdowns, etc., it's hard to say Brady won't finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2020. There's risk that he's just flat-out done, as well as risk of chemistry with no offseason, but Brady did workout with a lot of the skill-position players even when the NFL advised against it. He's not a top-five candidate, but if you snag him as a back-end QB1, he shouldn't lose you fantasy leagues.

days ago","text":"The knock on Wilson has forever been \"he doesn't throw the ball enough!\" That argument only holds so much water, as Wilson has now finished as a top-three fantasy quarterback in four of the last six seasons. Let me tell you... if Wilson attempted 600 pass attempts, he'd under consideration as the first quarterback off the board. Despite topping out at 553 attempts, Wilson has thrown at least 31 touchdowns in four of the last five seasons. There's been just one season he's averaged less than 7.7 yards per attempt. He's hit a 6.0 percent touchdown percentage in 6-of-8 career seasons. He's the good stuff. Can we anticipate more pass attempts? Sure we can. The first year under Brian Schottenheimer they threw the ball just 427 times. The second year (2019), that number went up to 516 attempts. Why did that happen? Not because the run game wasn't effective. It certainly was. It's because the Seahawks defense has trended in the wrong direction, which bodes well for Wilson's pass attempts. They did just trade for Jamal Adams, which will certainly help matters, but their front seven doesn't generate a whole lot of pressure. If they lose Jadeveon Clowney, it only gets worse, but I'd consider 516 attempts the floor for Wilson in 2020. When you add in the growth/chemistry between Wilson and D.K. Metcalf, the ceiling continues to grow. Don't forget that Metcalf was a rookie last year, while Tyler Lockett dealt with injuries over the second half of the season.

","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"This injury flew under the radar in 2019, but Carlos Hyde played the majority of the season with a torn labrum in his shoulder. The labrum is a rim of cartilage that helps to stabilize the ball and socket joint of the shoulder. Without it intact, there is a high likelihood of shoulder dislocation, especially in contact sports. Hyde underwent surgery in February to repair the torn labrum, which carries about a 6-8 month recovery timeline, indicating Hyde should be ready close to Week 1.

That's the end of the list. He's played his entire career with Andy Dalton. Now moving to Joe Burrow, the quality of the targets should improve. You could argue that Green didn't have a chance to work with Burrow this offseason, but that's the case with all of Burrow's new group of pass catchers.

After coming off surgery to repair torn ligaments in his big toe on his right foot, Green injured his left ankle in training camp at the end of July. His high ankle sprain required arthroscopic surgery to remove debris from the ankle joint, and from then on, Green just couldn’t get back on the field. High ankle sprains, especially those that are as severe as Green’s injury, are historically an issue for players trying to get back to full strength in the short term. They linger, cause recurring pain, and are easily aggravated by explosive activities (running, cutting, jumping). However, with a full offseason of rehab, more time to heal, and an additional offseason removed from toe surgery, Green will enter 2020 at a much better place from a health perspective. Update 8/18: A.J. Green picked up a hamstring injury in practice and is expected to miss a few days. While all reports indicate the injury is likely minor, it is still a negative for a player with a lengthy injury history. Worth noting, Green missed half the season in 2016 with a significant hamstring injury in his right leg, while this training camp hamstring injury was to his left leg.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"16638":{"fantasyProsId":"16638","tier":9,"playerName":"Blake Jarwin","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"10","team":"COWBOYS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-165,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":true,"handcuff":false,"tags":"SC*","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-flash","glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn","glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":15,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"31"},{"name":"YDS","value":"365"},{"name":"TDS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"31"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"3"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"365"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"85.5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"85.5"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"45.8"},{"name":"YDS","value":"519.8"},{"name":"TDS","value":"4.1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"45.8"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"4.1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"519.8"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.1"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"122.2"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.1"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"122.2"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"122","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"7.2","priorTotalPoints":"86","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"5.7","priorTotalTargets":"41","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"2.6","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"148","positionRank":"19","bestRank":"24","worstRank":"291","avgRank":"149.6","stdDev":"30.3","adp":"166","vsAdp":"18","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/co9fb8mszjci8nglgn5w","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/co9fb8mszjci8nglgn5w","picLocation":"/images/players/BlakeJarwin.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"2 days ago","text":"Did you know that Jarwin and Jason Witten combined for 124 targets last year?

The issue is that they are getting Jerick McKinnon back, still have Tevin Coleman, and Jeff Wilson. The passing game also got a new weapon, which could lead to slightly more pass attempts.

His season was ended in 2019 due to a Lisfranc injury that could affect his mobility moving forward, and he also had shoulder surgery after the 2018 season. In the two full games he played in 2019, he rushed for negative two yards. NEGATIVE. He needs the mobility in order to remain relevant in fantasy. Why? Well, do you know how many times he's thrown more than 24 touchdowns in a season? Once. Jimmy Garoppolo threw 27 last year. I'm not saying that Newton doesn't have any mobility anymore, but rather that he's lost a lot of it. Newton rushed for at least 539 yards in each of his first five seasons. Since then, he's topped 488 rushing yards once (over four years). On top of that, there've been just three quarterbacks who've rushed for 500 yards after turning 30 years old. Sure, Newton is a physical specimen, but that's also what likely led to his injuries, as you're not supposed to be as big as he is and move the way he does. Now you add in a shortened offseason, a new playbook, and new set of wide receivers, yet he's still expected to return to the old days? He's going to try, that much is certain. I'm guessing we get Newton Lite, something similar to what we saw in 2016 where he rushed for 359 yards and five touchdowns. I wouldn't want to draft him with ultra-high expectations, and for what it's worth, his draft position is perfectly fine, as he's going around the QB15 in Yahoo and ESPN leagues. By drafting him there, you have no qualms about cutting him for a streamer if things don't work out. Stidham will be waiting in the wings because you don't sign Newton to sit him on the bench.

After trying to rehab the foot, Newton was forced to undergo surgery after playing in just 2 games last year. Because of his playing style and being a mobile/rushing QB, I would fully expect Newton’s mobility to be negatively affected in 2020. This surgery typically requires at least a year for full recovery to prior performance levels. Another concern for Cam moving forward is his right (throwing) shoulder. Newton has now had two procedures in a 3-year span on his shoulder, one to address a torn rotator cuff in 2017 and one to address a cartilage injury inside the shoulder joint in 2019. Collectively, these injuries are likely to limit the longevity of Cam’s career, but with the Patriots in 2020, he should be able to contribute with his arm.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"11199":{"fantasyProsId":"11199","tier":10,"playerName":"Alshon Jeffery","position":"WIDERECEIVER","bye":"9","team":"EAGLES","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-205,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-20","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"i","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":10,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"43"},{"name":"YDS","value":"490"},{"name":"TDS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"43"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"4"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"490"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"1"},{"name":"YDS","value":"2"},{"name":"TDS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"1"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"2"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"122.2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"122.2"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"41.1"},{"name":"YDS","value":"506.3"},{"name":"TDS","value":"3.6"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"41.1"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"3.6"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"506.3"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0.3"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0.3"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0.3"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0.3"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0.3"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0.3"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"114.7"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.4"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"114.7"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"115","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"6.7","priorTotalPoints":"122","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"12.2","priorTotalTargets":"73","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"5.6","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"22"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"22"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"24"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"24"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"29"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"29"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"174","positionRank":"68","bestRank":"67","worstRank":"270","avgRank":"176.9","stdDev":"42.7","adp":"206","vsAdp":"32","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/qrbsgwhzlsmwgkdfjryh","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/qrbsgwhzlsmwgkdfjryh","picLocation":"/images/players/AlshonJeffery.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"2 days ago","text":"What can we say at this point?

That's led to WR2 or better numbers in 42.1 percent of games, which would've ranked as the No. 24 wide receiver in 2019.

One specific study that looked at NFL players coming off Lisfranc surgery found that just over 80% of players did return to the field, but it took an average of 10 months. Jeffery’s surgery occurred in December, indicating it is extremely unlikely he is ready for Week 1. This same study also found that offensive players performed far worse than defensive players after surgery, and in general, all players in the study showed a 21% reduction in performance in their first season back from the injury. Players who have this surgery also tend to miss more games than players who do not in their 2nd and 3rd years after the injury.

He's as safe as they come at the wide receiver position. Think 31 years old is too old? Check out this piece on what age a wide receiver declines. There are a lot of fantasy owners drafting Tyreek Hill over him, and while I understand the upside Hill presents on a weekly basis, Jones presents stability that Hill can only dream of. Hill has posted WR2 or better numbers in 21-of-43 games (48.8 percent) over his career. Meanwhile, Jones has hit that mark in 64.8 percent of his career games and has posted WR1-type numbers in 42.4 percent of them. Sure, Calvin Ridley is going to ascend, but a lot of his ascension comes from the missing targets from Mohamed Sanu.

Keep in mind that was while Evan Engram was out of the lineup. Slayton outproduced what everyone expected last year, being a fifth-round pick, but there's a real chance he's the No. 5 option in this passing attack when everyone is healthy. His average depth of target last year was 14.5 yards down the field, which ranked 10th in all of football. That further indicates a boom/bust player who's being taken as a low-end WR3/high-end WR4. If you want to believe in his ceiling, that's fine, but don't pay for it. He's in the WR4 territory and not as safe as Shepard or Tate.

Well, I hate to break it to you, but he was not a WR1 in terms that actually matter to you, the fantasy player. Despite averaging an elite 9.1 targets per game, Evans posted WR2 or better-type numbers in just 38.5 percent of his games. That ranked 28th among wide receivers. Seriously, guys like Sterling Shepard, Cole Beasley, and Jamison Crowder had higher percentages. Now you take away Jameis Winston, someone who was more than willing to throw the ball into tight coverage all the time, and swap him with one of the most risk averse quarterbacks in football? Evans' 2.4 yards of separation at target was one of the worst marks among wide receivers, and while it doesn't tell the full story, those who watch Evans knows he uses his body extremely well to box out defenders rather than gain multiple yards of separation with precision route running. Look, he's still a good player who's totaled at least 1,000 yards in each of his first six NFL seasons, so I'm not completely writing him off, though it does help that he's seen at least 8.7 targets per game over the last five years. I don't think Brady is as bad as some think at throwing the deep ball anymore, I just don't think he does it nearly as often as Winston did/was willing to. I'm expecting a slight dip in targets and less air yards, which in turn, equals less production for a player like Evans. It's not bad if you land him as your WR2, but I wouldn't recommend him as a WR1.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"BUST","text":"Mike Evans is a curious case for fantasy owners. On one hand, he's never had a season with less than 1000 yards receiving and likely will repeat that feat this year. On the other hand, he's seen a decrease in targets over the last 4 years, and last year showed how despite his elite talent level he can actually hurt your fantasy team due to inconsistency. There are variables in play here with an aging Tom Brady, and so we would advise you to be cautious when it comes to Evans.

However, with a full offseason, Evans will enter 2020 at full strength. It’s important to understand that relative to other players who have not had a hamstring issue, Evans carries a greater risk for a future hamstring injury.","source":"Fantasy

Bruce Arians used for Larry Fitzgerald back in Arizona. That's a very good thing. I want to do an exercise with you. Close your eyes and imagine Tom Brady dropping back to pass. What do you see? Do you see him muscling a pass towards the sideline? I didn't think so. I also saw him targeting a receiver over the middle of the field. Godwin played 63.4 percent of his snaps last year in the slot. He was second in the league in slot yards (838) behind only Cooper Kupp, and despite seeing 31 fewer slot targets than Kupp, he only finished with 15 fewer yards and the same number of touchdowns. Godwin's average depth of target was 10.4 yards last year while Mike Evans' was 15.3 yards. The average depth of target for Brady last year was 7.6 yards down the field. It's clear that Godwin should quickly become a favorite of Brady, who hates to take risks, as Godwin is a better separator than Evans. Believe it or not, there's a clear path for Godwin to finish as the WR1 in 2020. I don't say that about many receivers. He's in the tier immediately after Michael Thomas, Davante Adams, and Julio Jones.

days ago","text":"There's no masking it, Rivers was bad in 2019. He's now 38 years old (will be 39 in December), which is the age quarterbacks used to hit their decline (before Brady and Brees came along). Have we reached the end with him? He played behind a bad offensive line last year, something he's done through much of his career. In 2020, he'll play behind a top-three offensive line in football. He has already played under Frank Reich back when he threw for 4,286 yards and 31 touchdowns, then a career-high 4,792 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2015. Does that make a difference knowing it was five years ago? Well, yeah, in a way. The good news is that he at least knows the basics of the offense, which is important this year when we've had practically no offseason. The bad news is that chemistry will have to be built on the fly, and it's even harder when your top receiver (T.Y. Hilton) shows up to camp on the injured list. We did see Jacoby Brissett and Brian Hoyer combine for 22 touchdown passes last year and Andrew Luck throw for 39 touchdowns in 2018, so it's a good offense. If you want to select Rivers in a 2QB format, it could pay dividends, though his fantasy floor might be a bit lower than someone like Gardner Minshew who uses his legs. There are way too many variables to consider him anything more than a streamer in 1QB formats.

In every one of those games, he saw at least six targets. That's going to be difficult to come by during his time in New Orleans. Michael Thomas is going to get a massive chunk of the targets, and rightfully so. You don't want to start taking targets away from Alvin Kamara, either. And judging how efficient Jared Cook was last year, you'd be hard pressed to take away any of his 65 targets from last year. So, where do the targets for Sanders come from? He's now 33 years old and is clearly towards the end of his career. This was a better move from a football standpoint than a fantasy one. Yes, he's getting a big upgrade at quarterback, but you need targets to produce. There was just one game last year where a Saints receiver not named Michael Thomas saw more than six targets. He's a WR5 for me, which means I'll have none at his current cost of WR44.

I've already stated in the Drew Brees paragraph that I expect this offense to throw just a bit less in 2020. Initial projections have them around 560 pass attempts, so bringing that down to even a 28 percent target share would force Thomas to lose about 28 targets. You can see why a repeat of last year's numbers are unlikely, especially when you factor in the arrival of Emmanuel Sanders as a rock-solid No. 2 receiver who'll garner more targets than Ted Ginn and/or Tre'Quan Smith would've. Still, Thomas is my WR1 heading into the season, because outside of injury, he's projected as my top receiver by a full 15 half-PPR points.

days ago","text":"When someone goes from anywhere in between 6.7 and 7.7 yards per attempt throughout their first six years, then jumps up to 9.6 yards per target, we call that an outlier, especially when said outlier contains just a 286-pass attempt sample size. We can't ignore it, though. Tannehill put his name on the record books, as his 117.5 QB Rating in 2019 ranks as the fourth-best all-time. His 0.67 fantasy points per actual pass attempt ranked as the fourth-best mark over the last 10 years. What made it all that more impressive is that he was sacked every 10.8 dropbacks, which was the third-most often in the league. By comparison, Drew Brees was sacked every 32.5 dropbacks. So, that leaves us saying, \"Okay, we know there'll be regression, but how much?\" Under Mike Vrabel, the Titans have run exactly 58.8 plays per game in each of his first two seasons as head coach. We know they want to be a run-first team, right? That's why the pass attempts have been 432 in 2018 and 448 in 2019. That's a problem. For the sake of argument, let's raise that number to 500, which would be a massive difference. Even assigning Tannehill a number of 8.3 yards per attempt (Patrick Mahomes' number from 2019), it would amount to 4,150 yards. Then let's say he throws a touchdown on 5.0 percent of his passes (Dak Prescott from 2019). That would amount to 25 touchdowns. So, 4,150 passing yards and 25 touchdowns while comparing him to Mahomes and Prescott, while raising his pass attempts up to 500? Do you see why it makes little sense to think Tannehill even approaches top-10 territory? By comparison, Tom Brady threw for 4,057 yards and 24 touchdowns last year - he was hardly usable. Treat Tannehill as a streamer and you'll be happy. He's a great No. 2 quarterback to have in Superflex/2QB leagues because he's locked into the job and has shown top-five upside, even if it's highly improbable.

Unsustainable production. Sometimes you catch lightning in a bottle, and Tannehill has an electric weapon with A.J. Brown on the outside, but his touchdown rate was unsustainable.

days ago","text":"It's never easy to lose your top receiver during the offseason, which is what happened to Cousins when the Vikings traded away Stefon Diggs. They tried to replace him immediately, snagging Justin Jefferson in the first round of the NFL Draft. For a guy who threw just 444 pass attempts and offers no mobility, it's quite an accomplishment to finish as the No. 15 fantasy quarterback, as Cousins did. Now, with Kevin Stefanski out of town, you must wonder if the offense moves towards a more balanced attack under Gary Kubiak, though he may have been the genius behind the offense last year. Still, it's unrealistic to think Cousins throws the ball just 444 times again. Not only is the defense going through a rebuild process, but the Vikings just can't remain that efficient on the ground. Did you know the previous three seasons, Cousins was the (most recent first) QB12, QB6, and QB5? He's trending in the wrong direction, but he's still been a usable streamer in 1QB leagues. I'd be shocked if he's below 500 pass attempts this year, though he is going to become less efficient losing Diggs. Even if we repeated last year's numbers, Cousins ranked 20th in top-18-type performances, which make him a solid quarterback to use in 2QB/Superflex formats. He has no shot to lose the job, likely sees increased volume, and has finished as a top-five quarterback before. Just don't draft him in 1QB leagues as a starter for Week 1, because he's playing the Packers, a team he scored just 8.9 and 6.9 fantasy points against last year.

Here's the crazy part about Brown last year: He hit WR3 or better numbers in 73.3 percent of his games, which ranked 11th in the league. He only hit WR2 or better numbers in 26.7 percent of his games, which ranked 51st in the league. Now start removing targets to get Diggs his, and we suddenly lose some of that WR3 floor that he had. He is a good football player who just won't get enough targets to start on a consistent basis. Now, if Diggs were to miss any time, we could go back to playing him as a low-end WR2/high-end WR3.

The Dolphins bye isn't until Week 11, which is a long time for Tagovailoa to be waiting in the wings. You want to find a soft spot in their schedule to start him, but looking at their schedule, there's only a small window in Weeks 3 against the Jaguars, but that's proceeded by games against the Seahawks, 49ers, Broncos, and Chargers. In all honesty, Week 9 against the Cardinals might make the most sense, as they also get the Jets in Week 10, then their bye week. Whatever the case, Tagovailoa will start at some point. Fitzpatrick was a great streamer in 2019. In fact, he's been a great streamer the last three years. He's started just 23 games in that stretch but has posted QB1-type numbers in 14 of them, or 60.9 percent. Did you know that just seven quarterbacks topped 50 percent in 2019? As mentioned, though, the Dolphins don't have a great start to their schedule. Like most scenarios that have multiple quarterbacks, this is a situation to attack in 2QB/Superflex leagues, as you can snag both of them late in your draft and simply start the one who's under center. Fitzpatrick already showed he can make it work with the players around him, while Tagovailoa was once considered the No. 1 pick over Joe Burrow.

Well, I hate to break it to you, but he was not a WR1 in terms that actually matter to you, the fantasy player. Despite averaging an elite 9.1 targets per game, Evans posted WR2 or better-type numbers in just 38.5 percent of his games. That ranked 28th among wide receivers. Seriously, guys like Sterling Shepard, Cole Beasley, and Jamison Crowder had higher percentages. Now you take away Jameis Winston, someone who was more than willing to throw the ball into tight coverage all the time, and swap him with one of the most risk averse quarterbacks in football? Evans' 2.4 yards of separation at target was one of the worst marks among wide receivers, and while it doesn't tell the full story, those who watch Evans knows he uses his body extremely well to box out defenders rather than gain multiple yards of separation with precision route running. Look, he's still a good player who's totaled at least 1,000 yards in each of his first six NFL seasons, so I'm not completely writing him off, though it does help that he's seen at least 8.7 targets per game over the last five years. I don't think Brady is as bad as some think at throwing the deep ball anymore, I just don't think he does it nearly as often as Winston did/was willing to. I'm expecting a slight dip in targets and less air yards, which in turn, equals less production for a player like Evans. It's not bad if you land him as your WR2, but I wouldn't recommend him as a WR1.

Julio Jones, Mike Evans, Jarvis Landry, Michael Thomas, DeAndre Hopkins, Antonio Brown, Davante Adams, Amari Cooper, and... Cooks. He's done that with three different quarterbacks, and it's hard to say Deshaun Watson is a downgrade. The lack of offseason might prove to be a lot for the chemistry between the two, but knowing Cooks has transitioned well in the past, it shouldn't take too long. Concussions, on the other hand, are a big worrisome point. He only missed two games due to concussions in 2019, but they're starting to add up. It also affected his performance (clearly) in a big way, as he never topped 46 yards in the six games following the injury. There's going to be one of Will Fuller or Cooks who shines as a top-30 receiver with top-20 upside, yet neither are being drafted there. Knowing Cooks has been in this situation before, he gets a vote of confidence. If you land him as your WR4, you should be psyched. If Fuller misses any time, he'd be a must-play WR2 nearly every week.

Deshaun Watson hasn't been a quarterback to target his slot receivers a whole lot, but he's never had a possession-style on like Cobb, and he's never played without DeAndre Hopkins. Will things change? It's certainly within the realm of possibilities. The issue is that Keke Coutee and Kenny Stills are also solid slot receivers who can fill that role, if needed. My issue with Cobb is... what's the upside? Cole Beasley-type numbers from last year? He even finished as the No. 34 wide receiver, but was any fantasy owner excited to put him in their lineup? Maybe during bye weeks but that's about it. He's just a WR5-type option to me, and one who lacks upside.

you've averaged 14.3 yards per reception over your career. Fuller's volume will be there when he's in the lineup, as Hopkins' 150-plus targets have to go somewhere, and Fuller is the only one returning to the starting lineup who has any familiarity with Deshaun Watson.  You must understand the nature of his game before drafting him though. He's finished with fewer than 8.0 PPR points in 20-of-42 career games. He's also finished with more than 20.0 PPR points in nine games. He's been the definition of a boom-or-bust receiver, and one who's been hurt a lot (missed 22 games over four years). Still, with Hopkins gone, Fuller should see a bump in targets and become a bit more stable. If he's healthy, you should have zero issue plugging him in as your WR3 with top-10 upside. You're getting a discount due to his health concerns.

As I discussed in last year’s Ultimate Draft Kit, Will Fuller was a player who made me nervous given the fact that he was recovering from his ACL surgery and was also a player who had previously been plagued by hamstring injuries. However, 2020 could very well be the season we see Fuller puts it all together. He’s recovering from surgery to address a sports hernia (similar to that of Odell Beckham), and as discussed with OBJ, surgery often heals reliably and performance on the field is typically not affected. Fuller does carry greater risk than other players given his history of multiple hamstring strains, but he’ll be in his second season removed from ACL surgery, and research indicates players perform at a higher level in year two post-operatively. There is some risk with Will Fuller given the hamstring injuries, but compared to last year Fuller has a much better chance of staying on the field in 2020.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"15623":{"fantasyProsId":"15623","tier":7,"playerName":"Tyler Higbee","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"9","team":"RAMS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-76,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-2","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"B","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"],"handcuffs":"Gerald Everett","backups":[{"fantasyProsId":"16459","tier":11,"playerName":"Gerald Everett","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"9","team":"RAMS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-259,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-20","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"37"},{"name":"YDS","value":"408"},{"name":"TDS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"37"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"2"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"408"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"1"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"1"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"89.8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"89.8"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"32.3"},{"name":"YDS","value":"360.0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"2.4"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"32.3"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"2.4"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"360.0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.1"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"82.6"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.1"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"82.6"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"83","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"4.9","priorTotalPoints":"90","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"7.5","priorTotalTargets":"60","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"4.6","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"21"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"21"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"229","positionRank":"28","bestRank":"94","worstRank":"345","avgRank":"236.2","stdDev":"39.8","adp":"260","vsAdp":"31","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/rj2vwzixa1nf9h4nbasp","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/rj2vwzixa1nf9h4nbasp","picLocation":"/images/players/GeraldEverett.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"11 weeks ago","text":"Everett wasn't a startable tight end for most of the season anyway, but he dealt with injuries over the last several weeks of the year and was completely irrelevant.

In his first 26 games under Sean McVay, Goff threw 54 touchdowns on 858 pass attempts (6.3 percent touchdown rate). Since that Chiefs game in 2018, he's thrown just 28 touchdowns in 21 games on 806 pass attempts (3.5 percent touchdown rate). That's not great for a quarterback who offers nothing with his legs. He did throw two touchdowns in eight games last year but didn't hit three touchdowns until Week 17. Now you take away Brandin Cooks and Todd Gurley, only to replace them with Van Jefferson and Cam Akers? It's quite ridiculous, but the Rams didn't address the offensive line issues, either. Their offensive line was among the worst in football last year, which is a problem because Goff isn't good under pressure. He ranked 25th among quarterbacks with a 60.4 QB Rating under duress. The offensive line is the biggest concern for me, as that's the one thing that took a major step back last year, and it seriously impacted his numbers. The good news is that his pass attempts have been skyrocketing, which help make up for some of the decreased efficiency. Goff makes for a decent No. 2 quarterback in Superflex/2QB leagues, as he's not getting benched, and there's always the possibility he goes back to who he was, though I'm not counting on it based on the moves that were - and weren't - made this offseason.

Sure, he was bad in 2019, but he looked like the player we thought he'd be once they got to the playoffs, as he compiled 14 receptions for 288 yards and a touchdown on 18 targets in their three playoff games. The Chiefs also had an opportunity to move on from Watkins this offseason, but they decided to keep him on the roster. He may not be an every-week option from the get-go, but knowing you have a player tied to Patrick Mahomes who saw six-plus targets in 10-of-17 games last year should carry some weight.

He's done that with three different quarterbacks, and it's hard to say Deshaun Watson is a downgrade. The lack of offseason might prove to be a lot for the chemistry between the two, but knowing Cooks has transitioned well in the past, it shouldn't take too long. Concussions, on the other hand, are a big worrisome point. He only missed two games due to concussions in 2019, but they're starting to add up. It also affected his performance (clearly) in a big way, as he never topped 46 yards in the six games following the injury. There's going to be one of Will Fuller or Cooks who shines as a top-30 receiver with top-20 upside, yet neither are being drafted there. Knowing Cooks has been in this situation before, he gets a vote of confidence. If you land him as your WR4, you should be psyched. If Fuller misses any time, he'd be a must-play WR2 nearly every week.

Julio Jones, Mike Evans, and Landry. The way he got there in 2019 wasn't ideal (posted WR2 or better numbers just 31.3 percent of the time), but it was a horrendous offense. The issue now is that he's coming off hip surgery this offseason. While it seems like his recovery has gone well, that could be something to hold him back from being as consistent as he's been the last few years in Cleveland. Another hurdle is the limited targets that may be available in Stefanski's offense. The Vikings receivers combined for just 201 targets last year, and it would appear the Browns are trying to recreate that offense with both Austin Hooper and David Njoku in 2TE sets, while using the run game heavily. There's been just two times in Landry's career where he's finished with more than 7.0 yards per target, and he's scored more than six touchdowns just once. If he's cut down anywhere close to the 100-110-target mark, which seems very likely, it's really going to hurt his fantasy impact. Because of that, he's a WR3, and one who might be a bit dicier than in past years.

Now more than three months removed from surgery, Jarvis Landry updated the media in the middle of May regarding his progress in his recovery. Per Jarvis, he is on track in recovery but admitted that the rehab process has been more difficult given the Covid-19 pandemic. He also admitted that he “absolutely” made the right decision in undergoing surgery, describing that he feels like he won’t have to act like the “tough guy.” This suggests Landry has been affected by his lingering hip issue for multiple seasons. Landry posted workout videos on his social media in the middle of May of him retraining his running mechanics.

days ago","text":"What in the world happened to Beckham in 2019? If we were replaying last season, we wouldn't be drafting him until the fifth or sixth round of fantasy drafts. But that's where fantasy players go wrong. That's a one-year sample size. We had 59 career games prior to that we can look at where he was the best game-by-game fantasy wide receiver of all-time. Which do you trust? Everyone on the Browns struggled last year and knowing that Beckham was playing through a hernia only added to the disappointment. 2019 was the first year he'd posted WR2 or better numbers in less than 66.7 percent of his games (which is ridiculous). We know the offense is changing, but that also comes with some concerns. While in Minnesota last year, Kevin Stefanski's wide receivers combined for just 201 targets and a 43.1 percent target share, which ranked as the fourth-lowest mark in football. Stefon Diggs, who is also very talented, saw just 94 targets in 15 games last year. While I don't expect the Browns to be as run-heavy as the Vikings were, it's an added level of concern. But here's the thing - it's not like a lot of the wide receivers in the 10-15 range don't come with similar issues or question marks. Beckham has done it before and has true No. 1 overall wide receiver upside. He's in the prime of his career at 27 years old and his only competition for targets (Jarvis Landry) is coming off hip surgery. Getting him as your high-end WR2 is worth it.

In a recent YouTube post, OBJ admitted that he suffered a groin injury in training camp that was later revealed as a sports hernia and a torn adductor (groin) muscle. These injuries are notorious for being extremely painful with any type of explosive movements. It’s safe to say OBJ was playing at far less than 100% in 2019. Now about 6 months removed from surgery, OBJ is on track for a bounce back campaign in 2020.

By comparison, Robert Woods saw 139 targets last year, finishing with 90 receptions for 1,134 yards and two touchdowns. But for whatever reason, Matt Nagy has chosen not to let Miller flourish in the Bears offense. There were just seven games he saw more than three targets. In those seven games, he totaled 42 receptions for 547 yards, and two touchdowns. With Taylor Gabriel gone, it's very possible that Miller becomes more of a staple in the offense. He's best viewed as a WR4/5-type option with WR3 upside.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"SLEEPER","text":"Miller has a ton of talent.

A great compliment to the target machine that is Allen Robinson, Miller could emerge from the shadows as a more regular fantasy play. He had a nice 5 game stretch in 2019 but will need the consistency of a Nick Foles or much-better Mitch Trubisky to deliver on his sleeper potential.","source":"Fantasy

Based on where his targets took place, he had the fourth-most expected fantasy points among wide receivers last year. There's little reason to expect that to change, as the Bears lost Taylor Gabriel and replaced him with an older, slower version in Ted Ginn. There were just two games last season where Robinson finished with fewer than seven targets, making him an easy every-week start. In fact, he posted WR2 or better numbers in 62.5 percent of his games, which ranked fifth behind only Michael Thomas, DeAndre Hopkins, Julio Jones, and Davante Adams. The fact that the Bears snagged Nick Foles only helps the Bears receivers, as they have twice the chance at competent quarterback play. Robinson should be considered a high-floor, low-end WR1, as it's unlikely he comes with the ceiling of those with better quarterback play.

Julio Jones, Mike Evans, and Landry. The way he got there in 2019 wasn't ideal (posted WR2 or better numbers just 31.3 percent of the time), but it was a horrendous offense. The issue now is that he's coming off hip surgery this offseason. While it seems like his recovery has gone well, that could be something to hold him back from being as consistent as he's been the last few years in Cleveland. Another hurdle is the limited targets that may be available in Stefanski's offense. The Vikings receivers combined for just 201 targets last year, and it would appear the Browns are trying to recreate that offense with both Austin Hooper and David Njoku in 2TE sets, while using the run game heavily. There's been just two times in Landry's career where he's finished with more than 7.0 yards per target, and he's scored more than six touchdowns just once. If he's cut down anywhere close to the 100-110-target mark, which seems very likely, it's really going to hurt his fantasy impact. Because of that, he's a WR3, and one who might be a bit dicier than in past years.

Per Jarvis, he is on track in recovery but admitted that the rehab process has been more difficult given the Covid-19 pandemic. He also admitted that he “absolutely” made the right decision in undergoing surgery, describing that he feels like he won’t have to act like the “tough guy.” This suggests Landry has been affected by his lingering hip issue for multiple seasons. Landry posted workout videos on his social media in the middle of May of him retraining his running mechanics.

As you can see from the Shepard paragraph, Tate was semi-consistent with his targets, but you also have to factor in where he played on the field. Both Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram missed time throughout the year, which should've led to more targets for Tate. He had them most of the time, but even more importantly, he produced when he played. He produced WR3 or better numbers in 81.8 percent of his games last year. You know who did that more often than him? Michael Thomas. That's it. It is a new offense and Barkley/Engram are healthy, so don't expect that anymore, but understand that there's likely a place for him in fantasy football, especially when you consider the state of the Giants defense that'll be among the league's worst. He's not sexy and won't finish as a top-24 receiver, but he can be a WR4 type that you plug in when you know the Giants will be throwing a ton.

He played the big-slot role for them, which is something the Vikings should take into consideration when figuring out how to best deploy him. Unfortunately, Jefferson wound up on the COVID list and is being forced to miss a lot of camp. Still, he's a route-running technician who's playing behind a 30-year-old receiver who's been dealing with back issues. There's an avenue where Jefferson is relied upon as a rookie more than most think, though it would likely require Thielen to be out of the lineup. Under Gary Kubiak/Kevin Stefanski last year, the wide receivers saw just 43.2 percent of the target share (4th-lowest mark in the NFL), making it very difficult for multiple options to be fantasy relevant on a week-to-week basis. Because of that, Jefferson is essentially just a wide receiver handcuff.

The biggest downside is the run-heavy Vikings offense. In 2019, even with Adam Thielen missing six games, Diggs only saw 94 targets.

days ago","text":"It was a down year for Thielen in 2019, who's suddenly 30 years old (August 22nd, he will be) with back problems. That's not a recipe for success for a wide receiver, though it helps that he's the only steady presence at wide receiver. Most will look at the target totals from last year and wonder where his targets come from, but don't forget that Thielen saw 298 targets over the previous two seasons. Last year was an incredibly efficient year for the Vikings on the ground, and when you combine the fact that Thielen missed half the season, you can understand why their pass attempts came crashing down to earth. With the defense likely taking a step back after losing many starters, we should expect to see their run-to-pass ratio come back towards the league average, which would help Thielen's target potential. Knowing that he's the only receiver in the starting lineup who has any chemistry with Cousins, we should expect at least eight targets per game. That calls for him being a high-end WR2 at the very least when he's in the lineup, though his injury concerns have to be built into his cost. His current ADP is the WR11, which is too expensive for the risk you're taking on.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Adam Thielen injured his hamstring halfway through the season and was never the same, missing 6 games. He also suffered a minor ankle injury in practice while prepping for a January playoff game. Thielen got a cut on his ankle, which required stitches, so this is certainly not an issue for 2020. However, the hamstring injury could be a factor. No doubt, Thielen will enter 2020 at full strength, but relative to other players discussed such as Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, Thielen carries greater risk. Research indicates that older players are more likely to sustain an additional injury than younger players with the risk increases 1.3x per year with each year of age.","source":"Fantasy

Prescott's numbers have been just as good, if not better. He's never finished outside the top-12 quarterbacks and is about to play in the same system that just netted him the QB2 finish. Did I mention he also had CeeDee Lamb added to his arsenal? And do you remember all those years we drafted Aaron Rodgers as the top quarterback? That was with Mike McCarthy as his head coach (Prescott's new coach). If you're on the clock and choosing between Prescott, Kyler Murray, Deshaun Watson, and Russell Wilson, I'm choosing Prescott. There's the least number of variables with him, though Wilson is close. I'll leave you with this: Since Amari Cooper joined the team, Prescott has completed 616-of-916 passes (67.2 percent) for 7,369 yards (8.04 yards per attempt), 44 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. That's over a span of 25 games. He's also rushed for 346 yards and seven touchdowns.

days ago","text":"If there's someone who moved up my rankings when Cam Newton signed, it was Harry. I didn't like him much coming out of college as a wide receiver who didn't separate very well, but rather one who relied on winning contested catches. I knew he did that very well, but that didn't mesh well with the risk averse Tom Brady. As for Newton, he's shown the willingness to target his wide receivers with little separation. Look no further than Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess. The last healthy season Newton played, he threw into tight coverage a whopping 20.5 percent of the time. By comparison, Brady only did that 15.2 percent of the time last year and 13.9 percent in 2018. Harry also dealt with some injuries during his rookie season, which prevented him from playing in a full-time role. Will he play over Mohamed Sanu in 2WR sets? Probably not just yet, but he could be a factor in the red zone, where he works best.

days ago","text":"Did you realize Edelman has seen 793 targets over his last 83 games? That's a pace of 152.9 targets per season. But what happens when your whole world is flipped upside down? Losing Tom Brady is going to affect Edelman more than anyone, as those two had a connection and were continually on the same page. The Patriots also threw the ball 620 times last year, a number they won't even come close to in 2020. It's a different offense, yes, but did you know Cam Newton has never thrown more than 517 pass attempts in a single season? He's also failed to throw for more than 3,869 yards since his rookie year and has thrown more than 24 touchdowns just once. Meanwhile, Edelman has never averaged more than 7.9 yards per target. What does that mean? Even if he were to get 125 targets, his career-best wouldn't have totaled 1,000 yards. There's a lot of issues and question marks surrounding Edelman, and we haven't even discussed him turning 34 years old this offseason. He's likely to post low-upside WR3 numbers when on the field, but that's been a chore in itself, as he's played all 16 games just three times over his 11 years in the league. If you take the late-WR approach in drafts, it's not the worst thing to have Edelman as your WR3, but ideally, he's your WR4 with all the question marks and lack of upside.

Stafford's 8.2 yards per attempt was easily a career high and just the second time in his career over 7.6 yards per attempt. He's going to be a fine low-end QB1/high-end QB2, but he's not likely to be a league winner at this stage of his career.

The transverse process is a tiny projection off the side of the spine where muscles attach and is often injured via a direct blow to the region, as was the case with Stafford. Because of the muscles that attach here, the injury is often accompanied by intense muscle spasm and pain, but as long as the fracture is not displaced, it heals well over time. Stafford will be good to go this season, as this an injury that carries a low reinjury risk. It simply occurs via a direct hit to that region, so it’s nearly impossible to predict reinjury risk.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"8120":{"fantasyProsId":"8120","tier":12,"playerName":"Houston

The labrum is a rim of cartilage that helps to stabilize the ball and socket joint of the shoulder. Without it intact, there is a high likelihood of shoulder dislocation, especially in contact sports. Hyde underwent surgery in February to repair the torn labrum, which carries about a 6-8 month recovery timeline, indicating Hyde should be ready close to Week 1. I would also not be surprised to see Hyde play with a shoulder brace early in the season in order to help mitigate risk of an additional instability event.

While there is no confirmation of the exact injury sustained, Jones had his left ankle get caught underneath a defender while being tackled, a mechanism that usually results in either a high ankle sprain or a fractured fibula (lower leg bone) or both.

days ago","text":"You may or not know that Mike Mayock had an affinity towards Mariota during the 2015 NFL Draft. He's the GM of the Las Vegas Raiders, so when he got the opportunity to sign Mariota, he did. This is not great news for Carr, who has been solid, but not irreplaceable over the last two seasons under the Jon Gruden/Mayock regime. But instead of replacing him, they gave him competition, even if it's one he should win fairly easily. He's going to have a much better surrounding cast in 2020, as the Raiders drafted three skill-position players in the top three rounds of the draft, including wide receiver Henry Ruggs at No. 12 overall. The issue with liking Carr, however, is that he's never going to be an every-week starting quarterback in 1QB leagues; we've learned that by now. He's also not someone you can fully trust as your QB2 in Superflex/2QB formats now that he has actual competition on the roster.

Rodgers was the poster child for consistency in fantasy football. He may not have had the Lamar Jackson upside, but you knew he would finish as a top-five quarterback as long as he was healthy. Last year was the first time he finished worse than the No. 7 quarterback while playing at least 10 games. His QB9 finish was worse than it appears at first sight. Rodgers actually finished with fewer than 15 fantasy points in 10-of-16 games. There were four games that essentially carried him through the season, and those games were against the Raiders, Giants, Chiefs, and Eagles. Three of those were among the worst in football. Fortunately, Rodgers has a semi-decent schedule in 2020, as he'll play the Lions twice, Panthers, Falcons, Texans, and Jaguars defenses during the fantasy season. Was it the new offense he was learning? Was it the lack of weapons to throw to? Neither has changed, so it's tough to say he'll return to the Rodgers we all know and love as fantasy players, but his cost doesn't reflect that it's even a possibility, as he's being drafted outside the top-10 quarterbacks. If you're one of those fantasy owners who refuses to spend up at quarterback, taking a shot on Rodgers in the eighth or ninth round would make plenty of sense. He's 36 years old and has seven top-two finishes under his belt.

days ago","text":"If you're someone who listens to the news blurbs about players, you'd see that Derek Carr said Edwards reminds him of Davante Adams. Knowing they played together at California State, that's quite the compliment. Still, by statements the team has made, it appears that Edwards is on the outside of the starting lineup looking in at the start of the year, though that shouldn't last long. Here's my final line from Edwards' scouting report this offseason: If he gets an opportunity to play (was projected for 3rd/4th round), he can produce in the NFL. If they're planning on using Henry Ruggs in the slot, Edwards would make a good complement to Tyrell Williams on the perimeter. That would leave Hunter Renfrow out of the equation, as he's pretty much a slot-only receiver. So, again, if they're being truthful about Ruggs in the slot, Edwards should get some playing time immediately in 3WR sets, making him an intriguing pick in one of the last few rounds. You need players like him on your roster who you can cut bait on almost immediately if he's not getting playing time.

After drafting him in the third round last year, they had him playing behind guys like Seth Roberts and Willie Snead. He played just 27.2 snaps per game and saw just 22 targets his rookie year despite being healthy for all 16 games. He did score three touchdowns on those targets, and outside of Mark Andrews, he's probably the dark horse to lead the team in receiving touchdowns at 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds. Still, he needs to be on the field for that to happen. My guess would be that he starts on the perimeter opposite Marquise Brown with Roberts gone, so there's some sort of opportunity here. The issue is that they targeted wide receivers just 172 times last year. Even a 15 percent increase (which is a lot) would bring them up to 200 targets. Without an injury, it's going to be difficult for Boykin to see more than 50-60 targets, even as a starter.

Despite Walker going down for the year, Smith saw more than five targets just twice all season and finished with 44 on the year. With the offense still projected for less than 500 pass attempts, it'll be difficult for Smith to truly break out.

It does help his projection to know that Geronimo Allison opted out, as he's someone who could've stole slot snaps. Despite being targeted five-plus times in 10-of-15 games last year, Amendola topped 47 yards just four times, and it's not as if touchdowns will help make up for that, as he's scored once every 37.9 targets over the course of his 11-year career.

Yes, the Browns also picked up the fifth-year option on Njoku's contract, and then drafted a tight end in the fourth round. What a mess. This is a lot like the Vikings duo of Kyle Rudolph and Irv Smith last year. Don't forget that the Vikings paid Rudolph a lot of money (4 years, $36 million) just one year ago, after they had already drafted Smith. Do you know how that situation played out? Rudolph got 48 targets while Smith got 47 of them. The Vikings tight ends combined for 105 targets last year when you add in Tyler Conklin. Even if you want to weight them more towards Hooper, what are you looking at? A 55/40/10 between these three tight ends? The magic number for a tight end to be considered a TE1 is right around 80 projected targets. We cannot get there with Hooper. Njoku and his agent know that this is a bad situation and want out, but the Browns have said they're holding onto him because Stefanski loves to use two tight ends. The best-case scenario with Hooper is that he gets close to the 70-target mark and scores at least six touchdowns, though I don't see it happening. I'm staying away from this tight end unit unless some injuries arise. If Hooper or Njoku were to get hurt, the other would turn into an attractive option.

He then fell off hard, finishing as the No. 31 receiver over the final eight games, totaling just 36 receptions for 369 yards and five touchdowns. The Rams started moving towards more 12 personnel, which includes two tight ends, which in turn leaves just two wide receivers on the field. Knowing Kupp is a slot receiver by nature, it affects him greatly. He actually played just 61 percent of the team's snaps in Weeks 16 and 17. But I'd argue that Jared Goff needs him on the field. While targeting Kupp, Goff posted a 117.0 QB Rating. While targeting everyone else, that number is just 78.6. Sean McVay is consistently evolving as a play caller, which bodes well for Kupp, as he'll likely be expanded to different roles moving forward. There are question marks, that much we know. However, we have still yet to see a \"bad\" season from Kupp in the NFL. I don't consider him as safe as his teammate Robert Woods, but Kupp should still be considered a low-end WR2 who has more touchdown upside. I mean, he's scored 21 receiving touchdowns in 39 career games. Woods has 25 receiving touchdowns in 100 career games.

days ago","text":"Now entering his age-37 season, we kind of know what to expect from Fitzgerald. He did see a team-high 109 targets last year, and it's difficult to say his role changed much. He's going to be the safety valve over the middle of the field while DeAndre Hopkins and Christian Kirk work the perimeter. There were just six games that Fitzgerald broke the 50-yard barrier last year, so knowing he scored just four times, you understand the lack of upside despite his decent target share. Still, with Hopkins in the mix, that target share will certainly go down. Kyler Murray threw just 20 touchdown passes last year, so it was tough to expect more than the four that Fitzgerald scored. Even with a bump for Murray, it's tough to say the increased touchdown potential will make up for Fitzgerald's decreased target share. He's just a low-upside bye-week filler at this stage of his career. Even with an injury to someone like Hopkins or Kirk, we've already seen that scenario in 2019, and it wasn't more than a WR4-type.

So many fantasy players have seemingly forgotten it typically takes a few years for tight ends to become someone you can rely on. He saw 66 targets his rookie year and ranked 15th in expected fantasy points among tight ends. The discerning part is that he didn't tally more than four targets in any game with Drew Lock. In fact, he averaged just 2.8 targets per game with him, while averaging 4.7 targets per game with the other quarterbacks. We've now watched the Broncos add three talented pass-catching options in Jerry Jeudy, KJ Hamler, and Melvin Gordon this offseason, which won't help his target share go up. On top of that, they selected Okwuegbunam in the fourth round, who happens to be Lock's old college tight end who he loved targeting in the red zone. Fant is still the top tight end on this team, but I cannot say he's a lock to see 70-plus targets in 2020. That puts him outside the starting tight end territory, and knowing his ceiling might be around 80-85 targets, I would probably look elsewhere in the TE10-15 range for someone with true breakout potential.

Has seasons with 103 and 99 targets, so it's definitely in reach. We did hear that Gruden plans to use D.J. Chark in the slot a bit more, which tells us that Westbrook won't be pigeonholed into the slot role that he's been the last couple years. Westbrook has real speed on the perimeter and could be more than just a target-heavy slot receiver. We know that second-round pick Laviska Shenault had core muscle surgery this offseason which might put him behind the learning curve, and it's not like the Jaguars have any allegiance to Chris Conley, so it's possible that Westbrook is the 2020 version of Jamison Crowder in 2019 (finished as the WR31) with more vertical play upside.

That's the second-highest gap in football over the last two years, so you can say he's slot-dependent. If he can get back on Aaron Rodgers' good side, he'll have some streamer-worthy weeks.

While I don't disagree, there are plenty of wide receivers who've had bad quarterback play but managed to be useful. Samuel's 0.96 yards per route run in 2019 ranked dead last among the 157 wide receivers with at least 100 targets over the last five years. Heck, his teammate D.J. Moore was able to finish as the WR18. Based on the targets Samuel received and where they took place, he should have finished as the WR16. Look, I'm not saying Samuel is as bad as he was in 2019, but for him to become a reliable fantasy player, he'd have to overcome the fact that he's now the fourth-best target in the offense, behind McCaffrey, Moore, and Anderson. The Panthers also tried shopping Samuel this offseason, but ultimately held onto him. He's someone to look at during bye weeks when the Panthers are double-digit underdogs.

days ago","text":"Did you know that Williams was the No. 39 wide receiver through nine weeks last year? That was despite them having their bye in Week 5, as well as him not being a true starter until Week 3. He was extremely good his rookie year. He's coming off a torn ACL, which isn't an injury that's as detrimental as it used to be, but it may be tough for him to return as the same player in a brand-new offense. The Dolphins defense improved greatly, their run game should be much better, and they'll eventually transition to a rookie quarterback. These are all question marks, but fortunately, Williams is being drafted outside the top 60 wide receivers, similar to the way DeVante Parker was last year. Given their current prices (Williams WR61, Parker WR22), Williams seems like a much better value than Parker this year. Knowing that Allen Hurns and Albert Wilson have opted out, there are plenty of targets up for grabs, making Williams a solid WR4/5 on fantasy teams that you can spot-start depending on matchups.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Williams tore the ACL in his left knee in Week 9 of the 2019 season and shortly after underwent reconstructive ACL surgery. Typically, recovery after an ACL surgery takes about 9 months at a minimum, but the vast majority of athletes don’t reach peak performance until 11-12 months after surgery. Given that Williams tore his ACL in November, it’s realistic to expect a slower first month of the season. Worth noting, Williams could also be negatively affected by COVID-19 if there is a shortened training camp or preseason. Recovery after an ACL surgery takes acclimation back into football activities, so if there is no preseason program, Williams’ performance in 2020 could suffer.","source":"Fantasy

and most of the time not being drafted at all. Packers tight ends have failed to eclipse 103 targets combined in six of the last seven years. It typically takes 80-plus targets for a tight end to finish in TE1 territory without tons of touchdowns, and though Rodgers has thrown plenty of those, his tight ends haven't combined for more than nine touchdowns in each of those seven seasons. This would be Sternberger's first trip into the starting lineup, so it's tough to expect much from a young tight end, even though I did like him as a prospect last year. He's someone that you'll be able to use as a streamer from time-to-time, but he won't be your every-week solution at tight end.

The Steelers liked him so much, he saw a very-high 18.0 percent target share in his rookie season. It didn't hurt that JuJu Smith-Schuster was hurt and missing some time, but it highlights how much they believe in him. He'll play the \"Antonio Brown role\" in the offense moving forward while Smith-Schuster goes back to the slot. The downside is that Johnson will then see the opposing No. 1 cornerback, as they don't go into the slot very often. Still, throughout Ben Roethlisberger's long 15-year career (excluding 2019), he's supported two top-40 wide receivers in 12 of them, with 11 of them supporting two top-32 receivers. There is certainly risk with Roethlisberger's elbow, but at WR43 (his current ADP), you're getting a slight discount. I mean, even with Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges under center, he finished as the WR43 his rookie season. Snagging him as your WR4 would be a good idea, as I believe he'll be a WR3 more often than not.

The defense is in a position to allow a ton of points, which does add appeal to Bridgewater. We should see him rack up the pass attempts, and it doesn't hurt to know that his 6.2 intended air yards per target was the lowest in the league, which should mean a lot of short completions to D.J. Moore and Christian McCaffrey. The issue is that Bridgewater offers no mobility after his reconstructive knee surgery. That means he'll have to be more efficient than other pocket passers available later in the draft, guys like Kirk Cousins and Jared Goff. Again, with no offseason, that's going to be incredibly hard to do.

It's uncharted territory with so many question marks. Then you add in Roethlisberger, who's been rehabbing from an elbow injury that had him tear three tendons in his throwing arm. Yikes. His teammates have said he looks good while throwing the ball around, and have also said he's lost weight, and looks lighter on his feet. Many are undervaluing the Steelers this year due to what happened last year, but don't forget they averaged 66.4 and 66.1 plays per game in 2017 and 2018, while averaging just 58.6 plays per game in 2019. That amounts to an extra 120-plus plays for this offense with Roethlisberger back. The pass attempts dropped from 687 to 510. While that 687 number from 2018 was sky-high, the Steelers continually have averaged 585-610 pass attempts. We can talk about Roethlisberger throwing at least 26 touchdowns in six of his last eight seasons and that he's averaged at least 7.5 yards per attempt each year from 2014-2018, but none of that matters if his elbow isn't right. It adds a level of risk to the entire roster, though he was apparently playing through some elbow pain for quite some time, and it makes sense considering how three tendons finally snapped. We'll talk about it throughout the season in The Primer, but you should also know that Roethlisberger has been horrendous on the road over the last six years, averaging just 15.22 fantasy points per game compared to the 22.19 fantasy points per game at home. He opens the season on the road against the Giants, which is a juicy matchup, but should you trust him coming off the arm injury? I'd probably play it safe and stream him throughout the year once we know he's healthy.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Initial reports last year indicated that Big Ben ruptured the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow in Week 2 of the 2019 season. However, it appears this information was incorrect as details have finally emerged that Ben tore three tendons in his forearm. These muscles sit on the front side of the forearm and attach to the inside of the elbow, close to where the UCL is located, which is likely why the information was initially a bit misleading. Regardless, Ben underwent surgery shortly after to repair the torn tendons, and now knowing this, his quick recovery makes sense. This injury carries a shorter recovery timeline than your traditional Tommy John surgery, and the outcomes are more favorable, especially in quarterbacks compared to baseball pitchers. Even so, it’s important for UDK subscribers to know that this injury is an overuse type of injury. Short term outlook is very favorable after this procedure, but there is still some concern for long term longevity, which is more relevant if you’re playing in dynasty leagues. However, for 2020, my confidence in Ben is rising, and he’ll most certainly be ready for Week 1.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"8060":{"fantasyProsId":"8060","tier":14,"playerName":"Cincinnati

He missed time with a quadriceps strain and a sprained AC joint in his shoulder. Both of these injuries will heal well throughout the offseason, and Conner will enter the 2020 season at 100%. Both injuries carry a relatively low risk, so Conner could be a value in drafts if he can stay healthy. In his three seasons, he has never played 16 games, primarily because of a lingering ankle issue that has recurred over the last couple of seasons. He originally suffered a high ankle sprain in 2018 and actually aggravated the injury last year but didn’t miss a game because of it.

days ago","text":"Since coming into the league, Engram has been one of the most consistent tight ends in the league. Don't believe me? I've tracked all tight ends since the start of the 2000 season and Engram has posted TE1-type numbers in 58.8 percent of his games. The only players with higher percentages over that time are Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski, and George Kittle. Engram hasn't had the upside of someone like Jimmy Graham or Tony Gonzalez, but he's been reliable. Now in an offense with more weapons than ever, will that continue? Even with most of them on the field last year, there was just one game where he saw less than seven targets (he still saw five). Do you know how many tight ends averaged more than even 6.5 targets last year? Six. Engram averaged 8.5 targets, so even if we knocked off a full 1.5 targets per game, he'd still be in elite territory. Injuries have added up, though, and he's missed 13 games over the last two years, which is why he doesn't belong in the elite conversation. You need a discount to take players like him. Fortunately, you're getting that, as he's the eighth tight end to come off draft boards in the seventh round.

An elite big-play tight end, Engram has dealt with consistent injury issues throughout his playing days thus far. Despite this, he remains as a breakout candidate for 2020 due to the sheer pace he maintains when active and on the field. Much like George Kittle in San Francisco, Engram can score from anywhere on the field and is a quarterback's best friend. It all comes down to health, but Mike in particular is banking on Engram bouncing back in a big way in 2020.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Engram’s 2019 came to a premature ending after he suffered a Lisfranc sprain. After spending 6 weeks attempting to rehab the sprain, he underwent surgery in late December with foot specialist, Dr. Robert Anderson. The term ‘Lisfranc’ refers to several joins in the middle of the foot (near the arch) and is an injury on a continuum. The injury can result in a mild sprain of the ligaments or a complete tear of multiple ligaments along with broken bones. Given that Engram’s foot surgery took place in December, fantasy owners should expect a slow start to 2020. Most research supports that a minimum of 6 months is needed for the athlete to get back on the field, so Engram should be ready for Week 1, but don’t expect Engram to be back to his pre-injury level of play. Up to 70% of athletes experience pain upon returning to the field, suggesting this could be a management issue for the first month or so of the season.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"15561":{"fantasyProsId":"15561","tier":7,"playerName":"Hunter Henry","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"10","team":"CHARGERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-79,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-2","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"B","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"55"},{"name":"YDS","value":"652"},{"name":"TDS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"55"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"5"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"652"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"150.2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"150.2"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{"SKIP":{"colspan":0,"name":"SKIP","columns":[],"stats":{}},"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"59.1"},{"name":"YDS","value":"698.3"},{"name":"TDS","value":"5.1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"59.1"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"5.1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"698.3"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FL","value":"0.5"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"158.6"}],"stats":{"FL":{"name":"FL","value":"0.5"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"158.6"}}}}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":"159","projectedAveragePointsPerGame":"9.3","priorTotalPoints":"150","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"12.5","priorTotalTargets":"76","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"6.3","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"30"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"30"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"16"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"16"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"13"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"10"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"82","positionRank":"8","bestRank":"19","worstRank":"146","avgRank":"86.5","stdDev":"22.5","adp":"80","vsAdp":"-2","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/nwcg3wd0a8k4a4to3ze8","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/nwcg3wd0a8k4a4to3ze8","picLocation":"/images/players/HunterHenry.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"2 days ago","text":"There are a lot of questions surrounding the Chargers offense as we head into 2020, and the quarterback position is atop the list.

It does help, however, when there's a new quarterback on that team, as well as a coach you've played for in the past. Matt Rhule was the coach while Anderson was at Temple back in 2015. The issue is that Bridgewater's strengths don't really align with Anderson's. Bridgewater threw the ball 20-plus yards just 7.1 percent of the time last year, which ranked second lowest in the league. Anderson's skill set just doesn't align with Bridgewater's strengths as a passer, though they may try to force the issue after spending $20 million over two years on Anderson. Not having an offseason to build rapport makes me a bit more concerned, especially knowing we've seen Anderson's effort level best described as \"inconsistent\" on the field. It's tough to say he'll be a better fantasy option than he was in New York, only now his asking price is much lower. Being taken outside the top 50 wide receivers is a discount worth taking in best-ball leagues, but in redraft, it's tough to say he'll be a consistent contributor. He's the third option, at best.

days ago","text":"If you invested a first-round pick in Mahomes last year, you weren't happy with the results. In games he started, he posted QB1-type numbers in just 57.1 percent of them. However, there were some factors to take into consideration. One, he was going to regress. Two, he suffered an injury during the Week 7 game against the Broncos that seemed to affect him throughout the remainder of the regular season. In the seven games following that injury, he threw for three touchdowns just once, while throwing for more than 283 yards just twice. Was that a sign of things to come? Probably not considering he threw for 901 yards and 10 touchdowns in three playoff games. You must ask yourself, \"What's the worst/best-case scenario with Mahomes?\" prior to drafting him. Worst case was probably last year, where he was the No. 52 value-based player. That means if we'd drafted 2019 all over again, his value would've been correct as the 52nd player selected, so a fifth-round pick. Best case scenario is that he finishes as the No. 5 value-based player like he did in 2018. If you're somewhere in the middle, he's still worth a third-round pick with upside for more. Most of the time with Mahomes, it all just depends on your particular draft, as there are some who'll see him go in the first round of their 1QB league. You're baking in too much risk there. As a late-second, early-third round pick, you have some room for growth. Anything beyond that is just a steal. With the lack of offseason, it'll affect defenses more than it will offenses, so we could see a record-breaking year for Mahomes.

His average depth of target last year was 14.5 yards down the field, which ranked 10th in all of football. That further indicates a boom/bust player who's being taken as a low-end WR3/high-end WR4.

It is a new offense and Barkley/Engram are healthy, so don't expect that anymore, but understand that there's likely a place for him in fantasy football, especially when you consider the state of the Giants defense that'll be among the league's worst. He's not sexy and won't finish as a top-24 receiver, but he can be a WR4 type that you plug in when you know the Giants will be throwing a ton.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"VALUE","text":"There’s plenty of debate over which Giants WR will be the best for fantasy football. Golden Tate is being drafted the latest of the three.

Sure, Antonio Gibson is the new toy in the offense, but Ron Rivera has already said that he views him as a running back. When Washington goes three-wide, Sims should be out there in the slot, but that's just my opinion. We could see Gibson or even Trey Quinn play that role. Without preseason action, there are just too many question marks.

In the first year of Kliff Kingsbury's offense, he averaged just 6.9 yards per attempt. While it was his rookie season, the Cardinals also had the element of surprise, in that no one had existing tape on the offense. Adding DeAndre Hopkins surely helps his chances, though. Did you know there were six games that Murray didn't throw a touchdown last year? Based on where his pass attempts and rushing attempts took place, Murray should've scored the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks last year. Natural progression to his career should improve efficiency. If you're looking for upside, he's got it. He belongs in the same tier as guys like Dak Prescott, Russell Wilson, and Deshaun Watson. The difference between him and those guys? They've proved to be top-three fantasy quarterbacks already.

Murray's opportunity is before him, as the team has improved the offensive line and brought in arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL in DeAndre Hopkins. Murray gives fantasy owners a huge baseline with his rushing numbers, and last year the Cardinals converted so rarely inside the red zone that his fantasy numbers were deflated significantly.

days ago","text":"When the Steelers drafted Johnson in the third round in 2019, many did a double take, but once he got on the field, he proved worthy. The Steelers liked him so much, he saw a very-high 18.0 percent target share in his rookie season. It didn't hurt that JuJu Smith-Schuster was hurt and missing some time, but it highlights how much they believe in him. He'll play the \"Antonio Brown role\" in the offense moving forward while Smith-Schuster goes back to the slot. The downside is that Johnson will then see the opposing No. 1 cornerback, as they don't go into the slot very often. Still, throughout Ben Roethlisberger's long 15-year career (excluding 2019), he's supported two top-40 wide receivers in 12 of them, with 11 of them supporting two top-32 receivers. There is certainly risk with Roethlisberger's elbow, but at WR43 (his current ADP), you're getting a slight discount.

He played through multiple injuries and dealt with what was probably the worst quarterback situation in the league. In Week 1 and Week 2, when Ben Roethlisberger was on the field, Smith-Schuster saw 16 targets, catching 11 of them for 162 yards. Not too shabby. Insert bad quarterbacks, paired with Smith-Schuster trying to run routes from the perimeter, and it was a recipe for disaster. The Steelers have vowed to put him back in the slot where he belongs, and he's getting back Roethlisberger, who's continually supported fantasy receivers throughout his long career. Going all the way back to 2008, Ben Roethlisberger's No. 1 and No. 2 wide receivers combined for at least 225 targets on eight different occasions, including 334 times when he had Antonio Brown and Smith-Schuster in 2018. With Roethlisberger on the field, the Steelers haven't thrown the ball less than 584 times since way back in 2012. It's hard to see a scenario where Smith-Schuster doesn't see at least 130 targets if he's healthy (that would be just a 22.2 percent target share), which is elite volume, so even if he's average, he'd be a high-end WR2. I'll leave you with this... Smith-Schuster posted 1,426 yards in his second NFL season at the age of 22. There are just six players who posted more yardage in one of their first two seasons. The list includes Isaac Bruce, Josh Gordon, Torry Holt, Jerry Rice, Victor Cruz, and Odell Beckham Jr. We can't pretend Smith-Schuster is anywhere close to average. He's worth a third-round pick in drafts, even though many are getting him in the fourth.
