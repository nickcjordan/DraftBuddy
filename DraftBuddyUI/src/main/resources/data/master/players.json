However, 2020 could very well be the season we see Fuller puts it all together. He’s recovering from surgery to address a sports hernia (similar to that of Odell Beckham), and as discussed with OBJ, surgery often heals reliably and performance on the field is typically not affected. Fuller does carry greater risk than other players given his history of multiple hamstring strains, but he’ll be in his second season removed from ACL surgery, and research indicates players perform at a higher level in year two post-operatively.

In his 3-year NFL career, Cook has missed a total of 19 games. His injury history includes an ACL reconstruction procedure in his left knee from 2017 and now multiple shoulder surgeries on both shoulders. Most recently, Cook missed 3 games in 2019 because of shoulder injuries. He sprained the SC joint in his right shoulder earlier in the year then also suffered an injury consistent with a likely AC joint sprain on the left shoulder in Week 14. Cook had surgery to repair the labrum in his shoulder in 2014 (high school) and 2017 (college), so any additional shoulder injury exponentially increases his re-injury risk. Cook is fantastic when he’s on the field, but the shoulder injuries are piling up, and the risk is quite high.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},{"fantasyProsId":"23249","tier":15,"playerName":"Kene Nwangwu","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"7","team":"VIKINGS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-999,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":null,"roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":null,"priorAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalTargets":null,"priorAverageTargetsPerGame":null,"priorStatsByWeekNumber":{}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"440","positionRank":"123","bestRank":"308","worstRank":"392","avgRank":"356.75","stdDev":"26.55","adp":"1000","vsAdp":null,"rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":null,"smallPicLink":"https://images.fantasypros.com/images/players/nfl/missing/headshot/70x70.png","picLocation":"/images/players/KeneNwangwu.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[]}},{"fantasyProsId":"18621","tier":10,"playerName":"Alexander Mattison","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"7","team":"VIKINGS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-140,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":13,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"13"},{"name":"YDS","value":"125"},{"name":"TDS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"13"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"1"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"125"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"96"},{"name":"YDS","value":"434"},{"name":"TDS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"96"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"2"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"434"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"73.90000000000002"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"73.90000000000002"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"74","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"5.7","priorTotalTargets":"15","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"1.2","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"27"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"27"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"152","positionRank":"52","bestRank":"98","worstRank":"329","avgRank":"159.62","stdDev":"20.52","adp":"140","vsAdp":"-12","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/pmtcwk6iy794fhez1du6","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/pmtcwk6iy794fhez1du6","picLocation":"/images/players/AlexanderMattison.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"1 day ago","text":"When drafting a player like Mattison, it's not going to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

He also suffered a minor ankle injury in practice while prepping for a January playoff game. Thielen got a cut on his ankle, which required stitches, so this is certainly not an issue for 2020. However, the hamstring injury could be a factor. No doubt, Thielen will enter 2020 at full strength, but relative to other players discussed such as Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, Thielen carries greater risk.

Well, he caught 70.4 percent of his targets... at 15.9 yards a pop. No other wide receiver in the history of the game has totaled 1,400 yards on 125 or less targets. Bottom line... he needs more targets if he's going to live up to expectations because that's unlikely to happen again.

injury flew under the radar in 2019, but Carlos Hyde played the majority of the season with a torn labrum in his shoulder. The labrum is a rim of cartilage that helps to stabilize the ball and socket joint of the shoulder. Without it intact, there is a high likelihood of shoulder dislocation, especially in contact sports. Hyde underwent surgery in February to repair the torn labrum, which carries about a 6-8 month recovery timeline, indicating Hyde should be ready close to Week 1.

He tallied 26-plus fantasy points in eight games last year, which tied for the most in the league. Even better is that he had just one game that was labeled a bust, which lets you know he's a set-it-and-forget-it quarterback who can be played, regardless of opponent. When spending a high-round pick on a quarterback, that's what you need. Allen can start to be considered around the fourth round.

How many targets per game do you anticipate Beckham getting this year? I'm going with an extremely low number and say he averages 6.5 targets per game. That sounds more than reasonable, right? Beckham had 7.0 targets per game during the 2020 season before getting hurt and that includes a three-target game against the Steelers. The Browns were also throwing the ball a lot less early in the year as Baker Mayfield was still getting grasp on Kevin Stefanski's playbook. If Beckham gets 6.5 targets per game, that'd put him on pace for 104 targets, which again, is what I'd consider low. There were just 32 receivers in the NFL who hit that number last year, with 24 of them (75 percent) finishing as top-24 receivers and just two finishing worse than WR38. You mean to tell me with Beckham's talent, he can't produce top-24 numbers? There's health risks for sure, but there's also top-five wide receiver upside.

Targets are worth twice as much as carries, so even if Ekeler winds up getting just 12 carries per game, it's not the end of the world. In fact, he can still finish as a borderline RB1 if he were to hit just 200 carries on the season. The new coaching staff obviously brings on some potential volatility, but there's not much other talent on the roster at running back, so his role should be very safe.

After coming off surgery to repair torn ligaments in his big toe on his right foot, Green injured his left ankle in training camp at the end of July. His high ankle sprain required arthroscopic surgery to remove debris from the ankle joint, and from then on, Green just couldn’t get back on the field. High ankle sprains, especially those that are as severe as Green’s injury, are historically an issue for players trying to get back to full strength in the short term. They linger, cause recurring pain, and are easily aggravated by explosive activities (running, cutting, jumping). However, with a full offseason of rehab, more time to heal, and an additional offseason removed from toe surgery, Green will enter 2020 at a much better place from a health perspective. Update 8/18: A.J. Green picked up a hamstring injury in practice and is expected to miss a few days. While all reports indicate the injury is likely minor, it is still a negative for a player with a lengthy injury history. Worth noting, Green missed half the season in 2016 with a significant hamstring injury in his right leg, while this training camp hamstring injury was to his left leg.","source":"Fantasy

Engram and a healthy Saquon mean that Jones could surprise and be a great sleeper streaming QB option once he's through the rough start.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"17143":{"fantasyProsId":"17143","tier":12,"playerName":"Dan Arnold","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"13","team":"PANTHERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-317,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-40","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"C","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":14,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"31"},{"name":"YDS","value":"438"},{"name":"TDS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"31"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"4"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"438"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"65.80000000000001"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"65.80000000000001"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"66","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"4.7","priorTotalTargets":"45","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"2.8","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"18"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"18"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"9"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"260","positionRank":"31","bestRank":"133","worstRank":"325","avgRank":"254.48","stdDev":"36.38","adp":"317","vsAdp":"57","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/plszbijyee54szshyffw","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/plszbijyee54szshyffw","picLocation":"/images/players/DanArnold.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[]}},"17265":{"fantasyProsId":"17265","tier":5,"playerName":"D.J.

Opportunity is everything, and if he gets that type of opportunity again in 2021 while playing in all the games, he's going to finish as a top-15 running back. The only difference is that the Dolphins added Malcolm Brown in free agency, which could lead to him siphoning some targets away from Gaskin, which would be less than ideal.

In the 12 games without him, that number rose to 4.92 targets per game. Well, Cohen is back, and the team signed Damien Williams, who's a better receiving back than Montgomery. On top of Cohen missing, the Bears had a ridiculously easy schedule down the stretch, playing against the Packers twice, Lions, Texans, Vikings, and Jaguars to close out the season.

The ideal recovery timeline for the severity of this injury is 4-6 weeks, so the reported 2-4 week timeline might be too optimistic.

While they didn't sign him, it's not promising for Swift's outlook, as they clearly want this to be somewhat of a timeshare. It's not to say timeshare backs can't get into the top-12 conversation - they can, but it requires a lot of scoring opportunities, something we're not expecting from the Lions offense.

What we saw Higgins do as a rookie with Joe Burrow was impressive, as he was the WR11 during the eight full games they played together. Keep in mind that was with zero chemistry. Now you insert Chase into the offense, who already has chemistry with Burrow, as they set records at LSU together, and what do we get? I'll acknowledge that Higgins is going to cap Chase's ceiling and that he may not get to top-12 production, but you don't draft Chase at No. 5 overall (over an elite offensive tackle) if you're not going to highlight him in the offense immediately. Heck, even A.J. Green, who averaged 5.0 yards per target, saw 104 targets in this offense last year. Chase should be a WR2 right out of the gate.

A Jones fracture describes a break in the 5th metatarsal, or the bone on the outside of the foot. He’ll undergo surgery to stabilize the broken bone and faces an 8-12 week recovery timeline. Recovery after this surgery can be tricky given the reduced blood supply to this region of the foot. As a result, some athletes recover more slowly, closer to the 12 week mark. Regardless, this injury is notable for being problematic given the torsional stress on the lateral side of the foot during sprinting and cutting with about 15-20% of athletes requiring a second revision procedure. Deebo has a chance to be ready for Week 1, but expecting any consistent production in the first month of the season is unrealistic. A recent study showed that there was a decrease in performance compared to pre-injury levels by just over 50% if the athlete returned to play prior to 10 weeks post-operatively. Update 8/20: Deebo Samuel is making progress and has resumed running in a straight line, but the real concern is his ability to cut while running at full speed. I would still expect a slower start to the season for Deebo as he acclimates back into football shape.

It seems like a foregone conclusion that Ertz will be off the team soon, which clears a path for Goedert to be among the league leaders in targets for a tight end. It's a new offense, but Nick Sirianni comes from the Frank Reich tree, which has a history of producing tight end production. Goedert may not be a can't-miss tight end, but if there's someone who has top-five upside without being drafted there, it's him.

There is a new offensive coordinator, which can certainly shake things up, but the additions of Fuller and Waddle reduce the need for Gesicki's athleticism, and he's not a possession-style tight end. His upside is capped, and his floor might be in jeopardy, too.

Depending on the severity, Williams could miss Week 1 with less than three weeks until the opener. However, I wouldn’t expect this to cause lingering concerns throughout the season.

There's always the chance McVay keeps this as a timeshare with both Akers and Henderson healthy, but Akers is the one who was trusted down the stretch, including the playoffs.

Well, kind of. Despite Kenyan Drake struggling through much of 2020, there were just two games where Edmonds finished with more than eight carries, which is certainly a concern. The Cardinals went out and signed James Conner in free agency, but he's proven to be incapable of staying healthy with a full workload, and it wasn't a pricey contract, so maybe we see Edmonds in a bigger role. Whatever the case, we know he has the pass-catching role locked down, which has value in itself, as he was a flex-type option most weeks (he was an RB3 or better 62.5 percent of the time).

He's still yet to play 16 games in his four-year career, but when he's on the field, he's a surefire RB1. In each of the final 12 games he played in 2020, he touched the ball a minimum of 17 times, including 24-plus touches in nine of them. The craziest part about his numbers, though, is the fact that he has 97 receptions for 880 yards over the last two years, but just one receiving touchdown, so there's room for even more of a ceiling.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Recent news has surfaced that Dalvin Cook is planning to holdout unless he is able to sign a “reasonable” contract extension with the Vikings. It’s important for fantasy owners to know that how the Vikings choose to handle Cook’s contract could tell us a lot about how they view him from an injury risk perspective. In his 3-year NFL career, Cook has missed a total of 19 games. His injury history includes an ACL reconstruction procedure in his left knee from 2017 and now multiple shoulder surgeries on both shoulders. Most recently, Cook missed 3 games in 2019 because of shoulder injuries. He sprained the SC joint in his right shoulder earlier in the year then also suffered an injury consistent with a likely AC joint sprain on the left shoulder in Week 14. Cook had surgery to repair the labrum in his shoulder in 2014 (high school) and 2017 (college), so any additional shoulder injury exponentially increases his re-injury risk. Cook is fantastic when he’s on the field, but the shoulder injuries are piling up, and the risk is quite high.","source":"Fantasy

Williams fits that bill. He already has a 1,000-yard season on his resume. He also has a 10-touchdown season on it. He also happens to have one of the brightest young stars as his quarterback with little else on the depth chart outside of Keenan Allen. Health has been the biggest question mark for Williams, but once you're outside the top-40 wide receivers, there's hardly guaranteed production on the board, so take the upside.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Williams has been diagnosed with a “shoulder sprain” per Ian Rapoport, who also confirmed there is no fracture in Williams’ clavicle, typically an evaluation done for an AC joint injury. This injury can be problematic for wide receivers given that the joint is stressed with any overhead motions, which cause pain in the short term as well as a limited catch radius. Depending on the severity, Williams could miss Week 1 with less than three weeks until the opener. However, I wouldn’t expect this to cause lingering concerns throughout the season. The medical staff can use injections for pain control and additional taping and padding can be used to protect the joint.","source":"Fantasy

Four. He's posted 21.3 or more fantasy points in 22-of-30 games during that stretch, which is flat-out ridiculous. Since becoming the starter two years ago, he's posted QB1-type numbers in 76.7 percent of his games. The only other quarterback who's posted higher than 64.8 percent in their career is Patrick Mahomes, who's sitting at 69.6 percent.

That's not a huge accomplishment or anything, as he still failed to record more than 48 yards in 11-of-16 games, and that's despite Chris Godwin missing time to injury, and Antonio Brown not joining the team until midseason. We also can't forget about O.J. Howard, who had more production and targets than Gronkowski when he tore his Achilles. Gronkowski will certainly offer some streamable weeks, but relying on him as your every-week tight end would be a mistake with all the mouths they have to feed in Tampa Bay.

I'm sure he peaked last year with 2,027 yards on the ground, but now going to a 17-game season, maybe I'm wrong. Henry should be in scoring position quite a bit this year knowing the Titans went out and acquired Julio Jones this offseason. There's no scenario where your offense gets worse in that equation. However, we don't know how the offense is going to look in 2021, as Arthur Smith (offensive coordinator the last two years) is gone. Still, with Jones and A.J. Brown on the perimeter, it's going to be tough for opponents to stack the box the way they have against Henry the last few years, so his efficiency may actually go up.

The issue from a fantasy standpoint is that the Ravens' efficiency in the red zone with Lamar Jackson under center has led to fewer field goal attempts. After averaging 39 field-goal attempts per season from 2015-2018, Tucker has attempted just 29 field goals in each of the past two seasons. His increase in extra-point attempts (he's averaged 56 extra-point attempts the last two seasons after averaging just 33 the four prior seasons) just isn't enough to make up the difference.

The Chiefs didn't really add anyone to the offense who should jeapordize his targets, and in fact, losing Sammy Watkins may only add to his appeal. Not only did he finish as the No. 1 tight end and give you a massive weekly advantage at an unpredictable position, but he would've finished as the No. 4 wide receiver. So, if drafting a tight end early scares you, just think of him like a wide receiver who you can play in your tight end slot.

Unfortunately, the Lions aren’t an organization that gives much detail regarding their players’ injuries, so I can’t confirm whether or not Hockenson required surgery. Regardless, he can be expected to be ready about 6-9 months after the injury. Reports around the Lions’ camp suggest Hockenson is still not back to 100%, further suggesting he underwent surgery after his severe high ankle injury.

Then we saw Giovani Bernard get knocked out of the lineup for a few weeks, and it led to Mixon totaling 27.0 touches per game over the next three weeks before getting hurt. Now that Bernard is gone, are we finally going to get a full season's worth of 20-plus touch games for Mixon? If so, top-five is in the realm of possibilities, especially knowing he'll be more involved in the passing game.

Jared Goff has limitations as a quarterback, but his skill-set should actually align with Hockenson's role quite well.

These injuries take several months to heal and sometimes require surgery to stabilize the ligaments that connect the two lower leg bones together. There are reports that Hockenson was on a scooter (non-weight bearing) in late December, suggesting it’s possible he underwent surgery on the ankle. Unfortunately, the Lions aren’t an organization that gives much detail regarding their players’ injuries, so I can’t confirm whether or not Hockenson required surgery. Regardless, he can be expected to be ready about 6-9 months after the injury. Reports around the Lions’ camp suggest Hockenson is still not back to 100%, further suggesting he underwent surgery after his severe high ankle injury.

He started four games for the Eagles, and each of those games netted at least 16.3 fantasy points, highlighting a floor that's hard to find. He also flashed upside with a 37.8-point outburst in Week 15 against the Cardinals. The downside is that it was a small sample size, and Hurts appeared to get worse every time out. Even then, it's still a small sample size. There's a new coaching staff, along with a new No. 1 receiver, but if what we saw from Hurts in 2020 was his floor, we're in for a treat in 2021. If he can hone in and improve his accuracy numbers from 2020, there's legitimate top-six quarterback upside.

Hilton aging and Parris Campbell missing the entire season, Pittman couldn't break out in his rookie season. While that might be high expectations, the opportunity was there.

He scored just once, which surely didn't help his year-end totals, but with Campbell back in the mix, he isn't a surefire pick to gain a whole lot of targets. Hilton was re-signed, Zach Pascal out-produced him, and Carson Wentz has traditionally favored his targets over the middle of the field. Pittman should lead this team in touchdowns with his large frame, but he's likely to be a bit too touchdown-dependent to trust as anything more than a boom-or-bust WR4.

He’s had two major tendon repair surgeries over the past two years, something that spells bad news for Big Montana in 2020. Rehab after these two surgeries is long and cumbersome, with most research supporting a minimum of one year of rehab prior to returning to the field at performance levels comparable to pre-injury levels. The problem with these surgeries is the athlete’s power and explosiveness is negatively affected, usually resulting in worse performance on the field especially in year one. There is positive news, however, as Dissly has returned to the practice field and will avoid the PUP to start the year. I would expect Dissly to be eased into action to start the year, but there’s a chance we see production as the year progresses. Research shows players younger than 28 years old coming off an Achilles repair surgery perform better than those that are in their 30s.","source":"Fantasy

His high ankle sprain required arthroscopic surgery to remove debris from the ankle joint, and from then on, Green just couldn’t get back on the field. High ankle sprains, especially those that are as severe as Green’s injury, are historically an issue for players trying to get back to full strength in the short term. They linger, cause recurring pain, and are easily aggravated by explosive activities (running, cutting, jumping). However, with a full offseason of rehab, more time to heal, and an additional offseason removed from toe surgery, Green will enter 2020 at a much better place from a health perspective. Update 8/18: A.J. Green picked up a hamstring injury in practice and is expected to miss a few days. While all reports indicate the injury is likely minor, it is still a negative for a player with a lengthy injury history. Worth noting, Green missed half the season in 2016 with a significant hamstring injury in his right leg, while this training camp hamstring injury was to his left leg.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"16638":{"fantasyProsId":"16638","tier":9,"playerName":"Blake Jarwin","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"7","team":"COWBOYS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-193,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-40","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"SC","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-flash","glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":1,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":0,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":0,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0.0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0.0"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"0","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"0.0","priorTotalTargets":"1","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"1.0","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"149","positionRank":"19","bestRank":"92","worstRank":"260","avgRank":"157.42","stdDev":"34.42","adp":"193","vsAdp":"44","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/q6yng4c6ftrvviuxk44g","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/q6yng4c6ftrvviuxk44g","picLocation":"/images/players/BlakeJarwin.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"1 day ago","text":"Some will suggest that Jarwin can't break out as a top-10 tight end in 2021 due to the presence of Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, and Michael Gallup, but that's not really the case.

Ja'Marr Chase is going to be a real thorn in Boyd's side when it comes to volume, as he'll demand more than A.J. Green received last year. All three of the Bengals receivers saw 100-plus targets last year, so it's not like Boyd is going to simply fade away, but he's lost a ton of his upside as the No. 3 option.

Have the 49ers lost patience? They traded up to draft Trey Sermon in the third round, which could indicate they're ready to move on from Mostert, or it could be them ensuring they have a high-quality backup for if/when he gets injured. Mostert tallied at least 14 carries in 5-of-8 starts last year, which is more than enough to get into RB2 territory with his efficiency, but you can't draft him as such when injuries/Sermon are factored in. He's not someone you can confidently draft as a starter for your fantasy team because there's so much unknown. However, if he gets the job back, this is a pick that can make a difference in fantasy leagues. The 49ers have one of the easiest schedules in the league, so if they let Mostert get rolling, he's unlikely to slow down.

This surgery typically requires at least a year for full recovery to prior performance levels. Another concern for Cam moving forward is his right (throwing) shoulder. Newton has now had two procedures in a 3-year span on his shoulder, one to address a torn rotator cuff in 2017 and one to address a cartilage injury inside the shoulder joint in 2019.

For Jeffery his surgery is to address a Lisfranc injury, which will significantly affect Jeffery in 2020. Unfortunately, it’s unknown specifically which type of surgery Jeffery had (as there are multiple varieties of the Lisfranc surgery), but it spells bad news for his performance in 2020. One specific study that looked at NFL players coming off Lisfranc surgery found that just over 80% of players did return to the field, but it took an average of 10 months. Jeffery’s surgery occurred in December, indicating it is extremely unlikely he is ready for Week 1.

He saw at least six targets in 10-of-12 games despite all the other talent on the roster, which is never a bad thing. The downside is that Godwin never really got into any sort of WR1 groove. He didn't hit the 100-yard mark until Week 17, when Mike Evans was essentially out of the lineup. To be fair, Godwin was playing through a few injuries last year, which may have hindered his upside, but we did watch Mike Evans' relationship with Brady grow as the year went on. On top of that, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski returned to game shape, which will certainly cap everyone's upside. Godwin should be a solid WR2 on a weekly basis, but it's tough seeing him approach top-12 territory without an injury to one of Evans or Brown.

As I discussed in last year’s Ultimate Draft Kit, Will Fuller was a player who made me nervous given the fact that he was recovering from his ACL surgery and was also a player who had previously been plagued by hamstring injuries. However, 2020 could very well be the season we see Fuller puts it all together. He’s recovering from surgery to address a sports hernia (similar to that of Odell Beckham), and as discussed with OBJ, surgery often heals reliably and performance on the field is typically not affected. Fuller does carry greater risk than other players given his history of multiple hamstring strains, but he’ll be in his second season removed from ACL surgery, and research indicates players perform at a higher level in year two post-operatively. There is some risk with Will Fuller given the hamstring injuries, but compared to last year Fuller has a much better chance of staying on the field in 2020.","source":"Fantasy

How many targets per game do you anticipate Beckham getting this year? I'm going with an extremely low number and say he averages 6.5 targets per game. That sounds more than reasonable, right? Beckham had 7.0 targets per game during the 2020 season before getting hurt and that includes a three-target game against the Steelers. The Browns were also throwing the ball a lot less early in the year as Baker Mayfield was still getting grasp on Kevin Stefanski's playbook. If Beckham gets 6.5 targets per game, that'd put him on pace for 104 targets, which again, is what I'd consider low. There were just 32 receivers in the NFL who hit that number last year, with 24 of them (75 percent) finishing as top-24 receivers and just two finishing worse than WR38. You mean to tell me with Beckham's talent, he can't produce top-24 numbers? There's health risks for sure, but there's also top-five wide receiver upside.

It's why despite Robinson's lackluster quarterback play, he's been able to finish as a top-12 receiver in back-to-back seasons.

The Raiders have continually given guys like DeAndre Washington, Jalen Richard, and Devontae Booker work alongside Jacobs over the last two years, so Drake is going to get mixed in quite heavily, and my guess would be that the passing game is where he gets most of it.

No other receiver finished higher than No. 18 with fewer yards than Thielen. He's also going to be 31 years old at the start of the season and has a history of back issues, presenting a bit of risk, though he does have a ton of proven production with Kirk Cousins, which can't be ignored.

He also suffered a minor ankle injury in practice while prepping for a January playoff game. Thielen got a cut on his ankle, which required stitches, so this is certainly not an issue for 2020. However, the hamstring injury could be a factor. No doubt, Thielen will enter 2020 at full strength, but relative to other players discussed such as Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, Thielen carries greater risk. Research indicates that older players are more likely to sustain an additional injury than younger players with the risk increases 1.3x per year with each year of age.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"15600":{"fantasyProsId":"15600","tier":6,"playerName":"Dak Prescott","position":"QUARTERBACK","bye":"7","team":"COWBOYS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-50,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-5","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"C","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":5,"stats":{"PASSING":{"colspan":5,"name":"PASSING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"CMP","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},{"name":"INTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"INTS":{"name":"INTS","value":"0"},"CMP":{"name":"CMP","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0.0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0.0"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"0","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"0.0","priorTotalTargets":null,"priorAverageTargetsPerGame":null,"priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"56","positionRank":"5","bestRank":"36","worstRank":"91","avgRank":"57.96","stdDev":"8.73","adp":"50","vsAdp":"-6","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/kt6but6e6efqoox3e8k2","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/kt6but6e6efqoox3e8k2","picLocation":"/images/players/DakPrescott.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"1 day ago","text":"Here's a fun fact: Prescott's 27.0 fantasy points per game in 2020 was the second-most all-time.

day ago","text":"When you put Stafford's fantasy career alongside his peers, he's essentially the same quarterback as Matt Ryan. The difference? Stafford hasn't had a play-caller to bring out the best in him for quite some time and it's crushed his fantasy upside. Welcome to L.A. where you'll be working with Sean McVay, whose offense has been handicapped with Jared Goff under center. Could this be the change Stafford needed to reach the next level? The only concern would be that the Rams defense is so good, we won't get the volume needed for a pocket passer like Stafford. He has upside to finish as a top-10 option, but knowing his limitations as a rusher (with back problems), he likely won't reach much higher than the QB8-QB10 range.

The transverse process is a tiny projection off the side of the spine where muscles attach and is often injured via a direct blow to the region, as was the case with Stafford. Because of the muscles that attach here, the injury is often accompanied by intense muscle spasm and pain, but as long as the fracture is not displaced, it heals well over time. Stafford will be good to go this season, as this an injury that carries a low reinjury risk.

injury flew under the radar in 2019, but Carlos Hyde played the majority of the season with a torn labrum in his shoulder. The labrum is a rim of cartilage that helps to stabilize the ball and socket joint of the shoulder. Without it intact, there is a high likelihood of shoulder dislocation, especially in contact sports. Hyde underwent surgery in February to repair the torn labrum, which carries about a 6-8 month recovery timeline, indicating Hyde should be ready close to Week 1. I would also not be surprised to see Hyde play with a shoulder brace early in the season in order to help mitigate risk of an additional instability event.

The Football Team also signed Curtis Samuel in free agency, a player that's used in a hybrid role who gets plenty of intermittent targets, as well as a handful of carries per game. While McKissic was a hidden gem in PPR formats last year, it appears his role is shrinking in this offense. As someone who relies on volume to produce, McKissic is more of a passing-down handcuff to Gibson.

While I don't expect him to get there, he's one of just two running backs (Christian McCaffrey is the other) who I'm projecting for 100-plus targets in 2021. Targets are worth twice as much as carries, so even if Ekeler winds up getting just 12 carries per game, it's not the end of the world. In fact, he can still finish as a borderline RB1 if he were to hit just 200 carries on the season. The new coaching staff obviously brings on some potential volatility, but there's not much other talent on the roster at running back, so his role should be very safe.

He averaged 4.46 yards per carry, 5.73 yards per target, and scored 10 total touchdowns, which is solid, though nothing special. Enter Urban Meyer, who said they wanted to add depth/competition at the running back position. After adding Carlos Hyde, you knew Robinson would lose some touches, but it wasn't that much of a concern. After drafting Travis Etienne in the first round, it's definitely a concern. Robinson would be lucky to earn a 50/40/10 split with Etienne and Hyde, with Robinson being the 40 of the group.

Now going to the Giants, who have a bevy of options, including Sterling Shepard, Kadarius Toney, Darius Slayton, Evan Engram, Kyle Rudolph, and Saquon Barkley is going to be tough. To be fair, you don't go out in free agency and sign someone like Golladay to give him five targets per game, but he's not going to get the consistent targets he got in Detroit, and the targets he does get aren't going to be as efficient coming from Daniel Jones.

I'd rather take shots on the rookie quarterbacks who might not start out of the gate, as Carr certainly wouldn't be your QB1.

There's no two ways about it. To be handed the starting job just one hour before the game in Week 2, then go on to break the rookie record for passing touchdowns (31) is ridiculous. Now, with that being said, he still finished as the QB9 last year while throwing 595 pass attempts, the fourth most in the legaue. Now that he's got a defensive-minded head coach and a healthy defense, we could see the pass attempts dip a bit in 2021, which would certainly hurt his appeal. The Chargers did increase the talent on the offensive line, but also replaced Hunter Henry with Jared Cook, which is a certainly a downgrade. Herbert should still be a solid low-end QB1, but it's tough to see him finishing as a top-five option in 2021.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"ROOKIE","text":"Depending on who you talk to, Herbert is either a franchise QB with multiple tools to become successful at the NFL level or an unwise selection by the Chargers doomed to fail. Herbert should start the year behind veteran Tyrod Taylor but likely should take over at some point. Herbert will need time as he never took a normal snap under center in college as his Oregon squads ran predominantly out of the shotgun.

day ago","text":"Despite being an freakish athlete, Fant was an incredibly boring fantasy asset to roster in 2020, finishing with 35-57 yards in 9-of-15 games, while failing to top 81 yards in any one game. The issue stems from his quarterback, as the targets are simply not that valuable, because 93 of them (what Fant saw) is more than enough to be a reliable fantasy asset. Unfortunately, we don't know if Drew Lock will still be the quarterback, and the Broncos have Courtland Sutton returning to the lineup, which will surely cut into Fant's target share. On top of that, the team seemed to like using both Fant and Albert Okwuegbunam prior to Okwuegbunam's injury last year, which is another ding on Fant's fantasy stock. He's fine, but unless there's a change at quarterback, he's nothing you can't live without.

The issue, however, is that he's being reunited with offensive coordinator Scott Turner, who couldn't get the most out of Samuel during the 2019 season. While Samuel saw a career-high 106 targets that year, he averaged a minuscule 5.9 yards per target while used in an incorrect role. Will that change? It's tough to say, but Terry McLaurin, J.D. McKissic, Antonio Gibson, and Logan Thomas are all competition for targets with his new team. Samuel should have plenty of manufactured touches, but don't automatically assume he's as valuable as he was in 2020.

Typically, recovery after an ACL surgery takes about 9 months at a minimum, but the vast majority of athletes don’t reach peak performance until 11-12 months after surgery. Given that Williams tore his ACL in November, it’s realistic to expect a slower first month of the season. Worth noting, Williams could also be negatively affected by COVID-19 if there is a shortened training camp or preseason.

If Johnson would've averaged just 7.4 yards per target (easily attainable), he would've finished as the WR14.

reports last year indicated that Big Ben ruptured the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow in Week 2 of the 2019 season. However, it appears this information was incorrect as details have finally emerged that Ben tore three tendons in his forearm. These muscles sit on the front side of the forearm and attach to the inside of the elbow, close to where the UCL is located, which is likely why the information was initially a bit misleading. Regardless, Ben underwent surgery shortly after to repair the torn tendons, and now knowing this, his quick recovery makes sense. This injury carries a shorter recovery timeline than your traditional Tommy John surgery, and the outcomes are more favorable, especially in quarterbacks compared to baseball pitchers. Even so, it’s important for UDK subscribers to know that this injury is an overuse type of injury. Short term outlook is very favorable after this procedure, but there is still some concern for long term longevity, which is more relevant if you’re playing in dynasty leagues. However, for 2020, my confidence in Ben is rising, and he’ll most certainly be ready for Week 1.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"8060":{"fantasyProsId":"8060","tier":15,"playerName":"Cincinnati

His four-touchdown game in Week 5 really catapulted his numbers at season's end, as he failed to top 59 yards in 11-of-16 games, making him a touchdown-or-bust option most weeks. With Ben Roethlisberger's arm strength seemingly deteriorating by the day, it's tough to see Claypool having a true breakout season in 2021, as he relies on those high value targets more than JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson do.

day ago","text":"It's never a good thing for a running back to go from a workhorse role into a timeshare, but in Conner's case, it might be for the best. While operating as Le'Veon Bell's backup, Conner had pep in his step and performed like an RB1 when given the opportunity. But once he took over as the team's No. 1 running back, injuries continually piled up, letting his body know he wasn't capable of being that guy. Many are assuming that Chase Edmonds is the No. 1 running back in this offense, and while I believe that's the case, there's a non-zero percent chance that Conner takes over the Kenyan Drake role from last season that netted 239 carries and 31 targets. There's a reason the Cardinals signed him in free agency, so he will have a role, but the question is \"how big?\" He might be worth a late-round pick just in case he does get the Drake role (or even 80 percent of it).

He missed time with a quadriceps strain and a sprained AC joint in his shoulder. Both of these injuries will heal well throughout the offseason, and Conner will enter the 2020 season at 100%. Both injuries carry a relatively low risk, so Conner could be a value in drafts if he can stay healthy. In his three seasons, he has never played 16 games, primarily because of a lingering ankle issue that has recurred over the last couple of seasons. He originally suffered a high ankle sprain in 2018 and actually aggravated the injury last year but didn’t miss a game because of it. This is the concern for Conner moving forward, not the AC joint or the quad injury.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"14146":{"fantasyProsId":"14146","tier":15,"playerName":"James

Despite this, he remains as a breakout candidate for 2020 due to the sheer pace he maintains when active and on the field.

After spending 6 weeks attempting to rehab the sprain, he underwent surgery in late December with foot specialist, Dr. Robert Anderson. The term ‘Lisfranc’ refers to several joins in the middle of the foot (near the arch) and is an injury on a continuum. The injury can result in a mild sprain of the ligaments or a complete tear of multiple ligaments along with broken bones. Given that Engram’s foot surgery took place in December, fantasy owners should expect a slow start to 2020. Most research supports that a minimum of 6 months is needed for the athlete to get back on the field, so Engram should be ready for Week 1, but don’t expect Engram to be back to his pre-injury level of play. Up to 70% of athletes experience pain upon returning to the field, suggesting this could be a management issue for the first month or so of the season.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"15561":{"fantasyProsId":"15561","tier":9,"playerName":"Hunter Henry","position":"TIGHTEND","bye":"14","team":"PATRIOTS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-116,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"neg-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"B","icons":["glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":14,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},{"name":"YDS","value":"0"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"0"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"0"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0.0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0.0"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"0","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"0.0","priorTotalTargets":"93","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"6.6","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"0"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"133","positionRank":"16","bestRank":"63","worstRank":"246","avgRank":"138.09","stdDev":"23.52","adp":"116","vsAdp":"-17","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/qto6rnqkkyz810eellcm","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/qto6rnqkkyz810eellcm","picLocation":"/images/players/HunterHenry.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"1 day ago","text":"Henry has never been an elite tight end in my eyes.

It's because they used him in the possession-style role with a shorter average depth of target than he was getting with the Jets. The Panthers lost Curtis Samuel in free agency, but gained Terrace Marshall in the draft, and will get Christian McCaffrey back from injury, so the loss of Samuel doesn't do a whole lot for projections. D.J. Moore started coming on more as the year went on, though the switch to Sam Darnold could prove to be a good thing for Anderson, who was Darnold's teammate with the Jets. It's still the same offense, and Anderson proved he's able to contribute in a big way, making him somewhat of a safe WR3/4 option with WR2 upside should Darnold favor him as the top option.

If his touchdown % can increase (likely with the addition of Hopkins and the return of Kenyan Drake) then Murray is primed for a breakout 2020.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]}},"16422":{"fantasyProsId":"16422","tier":12,"playerName":"Wayne Gallman","position":"RUNNINGBACK","bye":"6","team":"FORTY_NINERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-288,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":"pos-10","roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"backups":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":14,"stats":{"RECEIVING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RECEIVING","columns":[{"name":"REC","value":"21"},{"name":"YDS","value":"114"},{"name":"TDS","value":"0"}],"stats":{"REC":{"name":"REC","value":"21"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"0"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"114"}}},"RUSHING":{"colspan":3,"name":"RUSHING","columns":[{"name":"ATT","value":"147"},{"name":"YDS","value":"682"},{"name":"TDS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"ATT":{"name":"ATT","value":"147"},"TDS":{"name":"TDS","value":"6"},"YDS":{"name":"YDS","value":"682"}}},"MISC":{"colspan":1,"name":"MISC","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"115.6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"115.6"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":"116","priorAveragePointsPerGame":"8.3","priorTotalTargets":"27","priorAverageTargetsPerGame":"1.8","priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"1":{"colspan":1,"name":"1","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"1"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"2"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"11"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"18"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"18"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"15"}}},"13":{"colspan":1,"name":"13","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}},"15":{"colspan":1,"name":"15","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"16":{"colspan":1,"name":"16","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"5"}}},"17":{"colspan":1,"name":"17","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"7"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"277","positionRank":"79","bestRank":"151","worstRank":"380","avgRank":"268.71","stdDev":"45.06","adp":"288","vsAdp":"11","rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/zlhxdru9d7ktq8kxylaa","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/zlhxdru9d7ktq8kxylaa","picLocation":"/images/players/WayneGallman.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[{"timestamp":"1 day ago","text":"I was really hoping Gallman would get an opportunity somewhere after flashing his ability in 2020 where he talled double-digit PPR points in seven straight games after taking over for Saquon Barkley and Devonta Freeman.
