Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley are one of the top tandems in the NFL and the additions of Todd Gurley and Hayden Hurst should give him dependable secondary options.

Almost a year removed from surgery, Roethlisberger should be able to support Juju Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson, and newly signed Eric Ebron in the passing game. He\u2019s just one year removed from leading the league in completions, attempts, passing yards, and INTs. If the volume is there, he\u2019s always worth a shot as a late-round QB with two to three nuclear fantasy performances looming.

However, injuries made him miss most of the season. He\u2019ll enter the season at 33 years old and hasn\u2019t played a full season in years. The Eagles traded for speedster Marquise Goodwin and selected Jalen Reagor in the 1st Round so DJax might be ancillary in Philly.","video":null},"4314":{"id":"15","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 15:02:40","player_id":"4314","blurb":"Embrace Brady in Tampa Bay or continue with the disdain and hatred of the ex-Patriots QB. Whether you think he is done or not, Brady had the 4th most passing attempts and the 5th most 20+ yard completions in the league. He also posted the lowest TD rate (3.9%) of his career but New England\u2019s weapons pale in comparison to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. With Rob Gronkowski along for the ride, Brady has the coach (Bruce Arians) and motivation to excel with the Buccaneers and finish as a QB1.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336223039\/f417921398"},"4807":{"id":"16","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-08-07 16:22:48","player_id":"4807","blurb":"Last season, Peterson was slated to be the backup to Derrius Guice, but another injury thrust Peterson into the starting role again. He continues to defy time and produce, and now could be the starter again after the team released Derrius Guice following a domestic violence-related arrest. However, they added Antonio Gibson in the 3rd Round of the NFL Draft, as well as picking up a few other vets. Antonio Gibson is the one likely to shoot up draft boards.","video":null},"4932":{"id":"17","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2019-05-27 19:05:00","player_id":"4932","blurb":"It\u2019s hard to make a case for Eli that doesn\u2019t start with, \u2018well, he doesn\u2019t miss games\u2019. He generally surpasses the 4k yardage mark, but has seen his TD production drop to levels where it\u2019s difficult to even want to stream him. Now the omnipotent Dave Gettleman has traded away the Giants' best WR and replaced him with a 30-year-old slot WR. The only reason Eli is on your fantasy team is if you play in a Superflex league and you need depth.","video":null},"5571":{"id":"18","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-24 16:48:38","player_id":"5571","blurb":"Larry Legend returns for another season.

He\u2019s had over 800 receiving yards in four of those five. Walker is about as not exciting as it gets to walk away with on draft day. Even with the additions of Corey Davis and A.J. Brown, it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where Walker is a flat-out bust. If you don\u2019t like early TEs but you also don\u2019t like streaming the position, if Walker is healthy and ready to go he\u2019s a fine value pick.","video":null},"7242":{"id":"24","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 14:53:00","player_id":"7242","blurb":"Despite playing just 11 games, Brees was as efficient as ever throwing 27 TDs and leading the league in completion percentage for the third year in a row. With Taysom Hill knocking on the door and Jameis Winston also waiting in the wings, Brees is entering his age 41 season, nearing the end for an all-timer.

With a one year deal as Frank Reich\u2019s QB in Indianapolis, Rivers finds himself behind one of the league\u2019s best offensive lines. Last year Rivers attempted the 4th most \u201cdeep passes\u201d of 20+ yards in the league but completed only 27-of-79 of them. Nine of those attempts went for INTs, which led the league. You know what you\u2019re getting: Rivers will force the ball often and check down to his RBs like it\u2019s going out of style. He\u2019s a streamable QB in the right matchups but not someone to depend on each week.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336223018\/5c498f9c32"},"8355":{"id":"27","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-08-11 20:43:44","player_id":"8355","blurb":"While 2019 was not ideal for the Patriots, it was Julian Edelman\u2019s best fantasy season yet with 100 receptions and the most yards of his career (1117). When has Julian Edelman played a season without Tom Brady? Never. That makes the entire offense a huge question mark as Edelman enters the season at 34 years old. Still, the fantasy football WR10 from last year is being drafted outside the top 24 wide receivers this year.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/338113957\/5c91eb8f9f"},"8534":{"id":"28","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-25 01:27:10","player_id":"8534","blurb":"Cook ended the year as the TE7, but was the TE3 from Week 5 on. The rapport he found with Drew Brees as the season ended was outstanding, and while the team added Emmanuel Sanders, Cook should remain a high priority in the passing game. Fantasy owners with burns from Jared Cook's past failures have left him further down draft boards than he belongs.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336910643\/db9bd1211f"},"8750":{"id":"29","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"8750","blurb":"","video":null},"9038":{"id":"30","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 16:40:06","player_id":"9038","blurb":"Poor Matty Snapback. He was on pace for almost 5,000 yards and over 30 TDs before his back gave out. We saw the resurgence of the old Stafford of the Calvin Johnson days past: he was second in the league in aDOT and had the highest percentage of \u201cend-zone\u201d throws. In other words, Stafford was focused on the money-making targets for fantasy which clearly benefited Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones Jr. He\u2019ll be undervalued once again in drafts and is worth a shot as a double-digit round QB in 2020.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/423824368\/463d6f187f"},"9331":{"id":"31","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-23 19:50:55","player_id":"9331","blurb":"placeholder","video":null},"9906":{"id":"32","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 08:32:54","player_id":"9906","blurb":"Amendola returns as the slot receiver for Matthew Stafford and the Lions.

The last time we saw Gronk really smashing was back in 2017. It\u2019s possible the time off during his one-year retirement let his body fully heal. It\u2019s also possible people expect too much from a rusty Gronk heading into a new offensive system that hasn\u2019t shown much reliance on pass-catching tight ends. If he\u2019s healthy, it\u2019s really hard to see him not finishing in the top 10 at the position. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to envision him finishing where we are used to in the top 3.","video":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/423831579\/cdb9167500"},"11056":{"id":"35","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-26 16:12:48","player_id":"11056","blurb":"placeholder","video":null},"11063":{"id":"36","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 08:06:41","player_id":"11063","blurb":"Sanders goes to possibly the best landing spot possible in free agency joining the Saints. While his age (33) may concern some, he actually played ALL 17 weeks last season because of being traded midseason from the Broncos to the 49ers. Coming back and fighting through injuries, he still showed big play ability last season. If you can grab him later in drafts, he should have nice upside any week with Drew Brees and the high-powered Saints offense.","video":null},"11197":{"id":"37","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-23 19:51:17","player_id":"11197","blurb":"placeholder","video":null},"11270":{"id":"38","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"player_id":"11270","blurb":"","video":null},"11488":{"id":"39","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-28 17:37:26","player_id":"11488","blurb":"Teams love giving Jimmy Graham a bunch of money.

Sterling Shepard is still there but has dealt with injuries. Darius Slayton had great chemistry with QB Daniel Jones last year in their rookie seasons.

Much like Gretchen\u2019s feeble attempts to make \u2018fetch\u2019 happen, the combo of The Thickness and The Quickness couldn\u2019t seem to get anything special happening. Lewis became a complete afterthought for the final four games when the Titans transformed into the Tennessee Derrick Henrys. Henry has dealt with a lower leg injury during this offseason.

</h3>
<p>
Matthew Stafford took a shot to the mid back in Week 9, causing a fracture of the transverse process in one of the vertebrae of his mid back. The transverse process is a tiny projection off the side of the spine where muscles attach and is often injured via a direct blow to the region, as was the case with Stafford. Because of the muscles that attach here, the injury is often accompanied by intense muscle spasm and pain, but as long as the fracture is not displaced, it heals well over time. Stafford will be good to go this season, as this an injury that carries a low reinjury risk. It simply occurs via a direct hit to that region, so it’s nearly impossible to predict reinjury risk. </p>

</h3>
<p>
Initial reports last year indicated that Big Ben ruptured the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow in Week 2 of the 2019 season. However, it appears this information was incorrect as details have finally emerged that Ben tore three tendons in his forearm. These muscles sit on the front side of the forearm and attach to the inside of the elbow, close to where the UCL is located, which is likely why the information was initially a bit misleading. Regardless, Ben underwent surgery shortly after to repair the torn tendons, and now knowing this, his quick recovery makes sense. This injury carries a shorter recovery timeline than your traditional Tommy John surgery, and the outcomes are more favorable, especially in quarterbacks compared to baseball pitchers. Even so, it’s important for UDK subscribers to know that this injury is an overuse type of injury. Short term outlook is very favorable after this procedure, but there is still some concern for long term longevity, which is more relevant if you’re playing in dynasty leagues. However, for 2020, my confidence in Ben is rising, and he’ll most certainly be ready for Week 1. </p>

<p>
It was a lost season for Cam in 2019 because of a preseason Lisfranc injury. After trying to rehab the foot, Newton was forced to undergo surgery after playing in just 2 games last year. Because of his playing style and being a mobile/rushing QB, I would fully expect Newton’s mobility to be negatively affected in 2020. This surgery typically requires at least a year for full recovery to prior performance levels. Another concern for Cam moving forward is his right (throwing) shoulder. Newton has now had two procedures in a 3-year span on his shoulder, one to address a torn rotator cuff in 2017 and one to address a cartilage injury inside the shoulder joint in 2019. Collectively, these injuries are likely to limit the longevity of Cam’s career, but with the Patriots in 2020, he should be able to contribute with his arm. </p>

<p>
Recent news has surfaced that Dalvin Cook is planning to holdout unless he is able to sign a “reasonable” contract extension with the Vikings. It’s important for fantasy owners to know that how the Vikings choose to handle Cook’s contract could tell us a lot about how they view him from an injury risk perspective. In his 3-year NFL career, Cook has missed a total of 19 games. His injury history includes an ACL reconstruction procedure in his left knee from 2017 and now multiple shoulder surgeries on both shoulders. Most recently, Cook missed 3 games in 2019 because of shoulder injuries. He sprained the SC joint in his right shoulder earlier in the year then also suffered an injury consistent with a likely AC joint sprain on the left shoulder in Week 14. Cook had surgery to repair the labrum in his shoulder in 2014 (high school) and 2017 (college), so any additional shoulder injury exponentially increases his re-injury risk. Cook is fantastic when he’s on the field, but the shoulder injuries are piling up, and the risk is quite high. </p>

Michel underwent a procedure on his foot to relieve pain that had been bothering him last season. His surgery was described as a “maintenance” procedure, which usually dictates an arthroscopic debridement or a “clean up.” Typically, these procedures take at least one month and up to two months to recover. Michel has at least two documented ankle sprains from college, so this ankle surgery isn’t necessarily out of nowhere. Michel will certainly be limited in Training Camp and has a chance to start the season on PUP. Entering year 3 in the NFL, Michel has now had 2 procedures on his knee and one procedure on his ankle. He also has a history of an ACL reconstruction surgery from high school. Update 8/3/20 - Michel will start training camp on PUP coming off his May foot surgery. This does not guarantee he will miss any games, but it will affect his participation in training camp, which could in turn affect how well he starts the season. I’m expecting a slower start to 2020 for the Pats’ RB. New England also brought in veteran back, Lamar Miller, as insurance incase Sony Michel does start the season on the PUP.

Rashaad Penny tore the ACL in his left knee in Week 14 of the 2019 season. The tricky part with Penny is that he reportedly suffered additional damage inside the knee joint (cartilage, a second ligament, or the meniscus), and therefore, Penny will require a longer recovery than another player who suffered a torn ACL without additional damage. Penny will continue to rehab throughout the summer and is very likely to begin the season on the PUP list.

This injury flew under the radar in 2019, but Carlos Hyde played the majority of the season with a torn labrum in his shoulder. The labrum is a rim of cartilage that helps to stabilize the ball and socket joint of the shoulder. Without it intact, there is a high likelihood of shoulder dislocation, especially in contact sports. Hyde underwent surgery in February to repair the torn labrum, which carries about a 6-8 month recovery timeline, indicating Hyde should be ready close to Week 1. I would also not be surprised to see Hyde play with a shoulder brace early in the season in order to help mitigate risk of an additional instability event. Following surgery, reinjury rates with this surgery are typically about 10-12%. </p>

Depending on the severity, Williams could miss Week 1 with less than three weeks until the opener. However, I wouldn’t expect this to cause lingering concerns throughout the season.

<p>
Deebo Samuel suffered a Jones fracture in his foot while training on June 16. A Jones fracture describes a break in the 5th metatarsal, or the bone on the outside of the foot. He’ll undergo surgery to stabilize the broken bone and faces an 8-12 week recovery timeline. Recovery after this surgery can be tricky given the reduced blood supply to this region of the foot. As a result, some athletes recover more slowly, closer to the 12 week mark. Regardless, this injury is notable for being problematic given the torsional stress on the lateral side of the foot during sprinting and cutting with about 15-20% of athletes requiring a second revision procedure. Deebo has a chance to be ready for Week 1, but expecting any consistent production in the first month of the season is unrealistic. A recent study showed that there was a decrease in performance compared to pre-injury levels by just over 50% if the athlete returned to play prior to 10 weeks post-operatively. Update 8/20: Deebo Samuel is making progress and has resumed running in a straight line, but the real concern is his ability to cut while running at full speed. I would still expect a slower start to the season for Deebo as he acclimates back into football shape. Starting the season on PUP remains a possibility. </p>

Ridley suffered an abdominal injury in Week 14 of the 2019 season and was shut down for the remainder of the season. Details regarding the specifics of the injury are sparse, but all indications are that Ridley has made a full recovery and is already working out at full capacity. I suspect this was some sort of internal organ injury, which requires close monitoring in the hospital. However, for 2020, Ridley appears to be on track and can be drafted with confidence. </p>

Adam Thielen injured his hamstring halfway through the season and was never the same, missing 6 games. He also suffered a minor ankle injury in practice while prepping for a January playoff game. Thielen got a cut on his ankle, which required stitches, so this is certainly not an issue for 2020. However, the hamstring injury could be a factor. No doubt, Thielen will enter 2020 at full strength, but relative to other players discussed such as Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, Thielen carries greater risk.

Odell Beckham dealt with groin and hip pain for the entire 2019 season.

Landry posted workout videos on his social media in the middle of May of him retraining his running mechanics. These movements suggest Landry is on track in his recovery and should be ready for Week 1 with research studies indicating about 92% of players successfully return to the field following this procedure. </p>

And, the risk for recurring injury increases by about 1.3x with each year of age. </p>

<p>
Green didn’t play a single snap in 2019. After coming off surgery to repair torn ligaments in his big toe on his right foot, Green injured his left ankle in training camp at the end of July. His high ankle sprain required arthroscopic surgery to remove debris from the ankle joint, and from then on, Green just couldn’t get back on the field. High ankle sprains, especially those that are as severe as Green’s injury, are historically an issue for players trying to get back to full strength in the short term. They linger, cause recurring pain, and are easily aggravated by explosive activities (running, cutting, jumping). However, with a full offseason of rehab, more time to heal, and an additional offseason removed from toe surgery, Green will enter 2020 at a much better place from a health perspective. Update 8/18: A.J. Green picked up a hamstring injury in practice and is expected to miss a few days. While all reports indicate the injury is likely minor, it is still a negative for a player with a lengthy injury history. Worth noting, Green missed half the season in 2016 with a significant hamstring injury in his right leg, while this training camp hamstring injury was to his left leg. </p>

Marvin Jones’ 2019 campaign ended early after a Week 14 ankle injury. While there is no confirmation of the exact injury sustained, Jones had his left ankle get caught underneath a defender while being tackled, a mechanism that usually results in either a high ankle sprain or a fractured fibula (lower leg bone) or both. Immediately after the play, Jones struggled to put any weight on his leg, causing concern for a fracture. There has been no indication of surgery for Jones this offseason, however. Given the lack of clarity regarding the situation, it’s difficult to speak to Jones’ 2020 injury risk. Look for more updates throughout the summer. </p>

 <p>
It was a down year in 2019 for Will Fuller, who was hampered by multiple hamstring strains coming off 2018 ACL surgery in his knee. As I discussed in last year’s Ultimate Draft Kit, Will Fuller was a player who made me nervous given the fact that he was recovering from his ACL surgery and was also a player who had previously been plagued by hamstring injuries. However, 2020 could very well be the season we see Fuller puts it all together. He’s recovering from surgery to address a sports hernia (similar to that of Odell Beckham), and as discussed with OBJ, surgery often heals reliably and performance on the field is typically not affected. Fuller does carry greater risk than other players given his history of multiple hamstring strains, but he’ll be in his second season removed from ACL surgery, and research indicates players perform at a higher level in year two post-operatively. There is some risk with Will Fuller given the hamstring injuries, but compared to last year Fuller has a much better chance of staying on the field in 2020. </p>

Jeffery suffered a sprain in his right foot in Week 14, which required season-ending surgery. For Jeffery his surgery is to address a Lisfranc injury, which will significantly affect Jeffery in 2020. Unfortunately, it’s unknown specifically which type of surgery Jeffery had (as there are multiple varieties of the Lisfranc surgery), but it spells bad news for his performance in 2020. One specific study that looked at NFL players coming off Lisfranc surgery found that just over 80% of players did return to the field, but it took an average of 10 months. Jeffery’s surgery occurred in December, indicating it is extremely unlikely he is ready for Week 1. This same study also found that offensive players performed far worse than defensive players after surgery, and in general, all players in the study showed a 21% reduction in performance in their first season back from the injury. Players who have this surgery also tend to miss more games than players who do not in their 2nd and 3rd years after the injury. At 30 years old, Jeffery is a player who is extremely unlikely to return value in 2020. </p>

<p>
Williams tore the ACL in his left knee in Week 9 of the 2019 season and shortly after underwent reconstructive ACL surgery. Typically, recovery after an ACL surgery takes about 9 months at a minimum, but the vast majority of athletes don’t reach peak performance until 11-12 months after surgery. Given that Williams tore his ACL in November, it’s realistic to expect a slower first month of the season. Worth noting, Williams could also be negatively affected by COVID-19 if there is a shortened training camp or preseason. Recovery after an ACL surgery takes acclimation back into football activities, so if there is no preseason program, Williams’ performance in 2020 could suffer. </p>

<p>
Engram’s 2019 came to a premature ending after he suffered a Lisfranc sprain. After spending 6 weeks attempting to rehab the sprain, he underwent surgery in late December with foot specialist, Dr. Robert Anderson. The term ‘Lisfranc’ refers to several joins in the middle of the foot (near the arch) and is an injury on a continuum. The injury can result in a mild sprain of the ligaments or a complete tear of multiple ligaments along with broken bones. Given that Engram’s foot surgery took place in December, fantasy owners should expect a slow start to 2020. Most research supports that a minimum of 6 months is needed for the athlete to get back on the field, so Engram should be ready for Week 1, but don’t expect Engram to be back to his pre-injury level of play. Up to 70% of athletes experience pain upon returning to the field, suggesting this could be a management issue for the first month or so of the season. </p>

Unfortunately, the Lions aren’t an organization that gives much detail regarding their players’ injuries, so I can’t confirm whether or not Hockenson required surgery. Regardless, he can be expected to be ready about 6-9 months after the injury. Reports around the Lions’ camp suggest Hockenson is still not back to 100%, further suggesting he underwent surgery after his severe high ankle injury.

<p>
Dissly has had a spell of terrible luck over the past two seasons. He tore the patellar tendon in his right knee in 2018 then tore the Achilles tendon in his left leg in Week 6 of 2019. He’s had two major tendon repair surgeries over the past two years, something that spells bad news for Big Montana in 2020. Rehab after these two surgeries is long and cumbersome, with most research supporting a minimum of one year of rehab prior to returning to the field at performance levels comparable to pre-injury levels. The problem with these surgeries is the athlete’s power and explosiveness is negatively affected, usually resulting in worse performance on the field especially in year one. There is positive news, however, as Dissly has returned to the practice field and will avoid the PUP to start the year. I would expect Dissly to be eased into action to start the year, but there’s a chance we see production as the year progresses. Research shows players younger than 28 years old coming off an Achilles repair surgery perform better than those that are in their 30s. </p>
