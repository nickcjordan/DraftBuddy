However, with the way Sean Payton rotates his running backs, it's going to be mighty hard for Kamara to live up to his draft cost now that Drew Brees is gone. Brees targeted his running backs at least 28 percent of the time in each of the last four years. Meanwhile, Jameis Winston hasn't targeted running backs more than 18 percent of the time in each of his last four seasons as a starter. The offense is also not nearly as likely to be scoring as many points without Brees. Upon finding out that Michael Thomas will miss time to start the season, it only makes Kamara more valuable, as he could be in line for eight-plus targets per game during that time.                                                </div>

Every year he's been in the league, we've watched his rushing yardage go up by at least 250 yards. I'm sure he peaked last year with 2,027 yards on the ground, but now going to a 17-game season, maybe I'm wrong. Henry should be in scoring position quite a bit this year knowing the Titans went out and acquired Julio Jones this offseason. There's no scenario where your offense gets worse in that equation. However, we don't know how the offense is going to look in 2021, as Arthur Smith (offensive coordinator the last two years) is gone. Still, with Jones and A.J. Brown on the perimeter, it's going to be tough for opponents to stack the box the way they have against Henry the last few years, so his efficiency may actually go up. There are certainly some variables to his projections, but Henry has proven that despite his lack of usage in the passing game, he's going to make up for it on the ground.                                                </div>

Over a full 16-game season, that amounts to 126 targets. While I don't expect him to get there, he's one of just two running backs (Christian McCaffrey is the other) who I'm projecting for 100-plus targets in 2021. Targets are worth twice as much as carries, so even if Ekeler winds up getting just 12 carries per game, it's not the end of the world. In fact, he can still finish as a borderline RB1 if he were to hit just 200 carries on the season. The new coaching staff obviously brings on some potential volatility, but there's not much other talent on the roster at running back, so his role should be very safe.                                                </div>

Aaron Jones has finished No. 7, No. 4, No. 4, and No. 16 over the last four years on that list, which highlights just how good he is. During that time, he's scored 143.4 more fantasy points than the average running back would've. Him and Alvin Kamara are much more similar than most realize. You take proven production at the top of drafts, and Jones has proven it time-and-time again. If Aaron Rodgers doesn't ever show up to the Packers, he does lose a bit of his touchdown upside, though.                                                </div>

He tore his ACL early in the season, which should give him plenty of time to bounce back, though his violent running style could take a bit longer in recovery. The Giants suddenly have more weapons than ever in the passing game, so Barkley is unlikely to come close to the 121 targets he saw in 2018, though he should have more scoring opportunities. There is some risk with Barkley at the top of drafts due to his knee, but when on the field, we know he'll produce.                                                </div>

Just how much better can he be with Jones out of town?

In the eight games Ridley has played without Jones, he's averaged 11.1 targets, 7.3 receptions, 107.0 yards, and 0.4 touchdowns, adding up to 20.1 PPR points per game. He should be a lock for 140-plus targets in 2021, making him a safe WR1.                                                </div>

The Chiefs didn't really add anyone to the offense who should jeapordize his targets, and in fact, losing Sammy Watkins may only add to his appeal. Not only did he finish as the No. 1 tight end and give you a massive weekly advantage at an unpredictable position, but he would've finished as the No. 4 wide receiver. So, if drafting a tight end early scares you, just think of him like a wide receiver who you can play in your tight end slot. He's worth a late first-round pick.                                                </div>

I like Taylor, but did everyone forget about what happened the first 10 weeks of the season? Taylor was the RB19 and David Montgomery was the RB20. Taylor finished the year as the RB6 while Montgomery was the RB4. Many will talk about Montgomery's schedule as the reason for his production, hence why he's ranked at RB20 in ECR right now, but are they ignoring Taylor's schedule? He played against the Texans TWICE, Packers, Raiders, Jaguars, and the Steelers (who were decimated by injuries in that game). That's a large reason for his jump in production. I still like Taylor, just not nearly as much as the consensus.                                                </div>

Not only was he a rookie, which is amazing in it's own right, but to finish with 1,400 yards on just 125 targets is ridiculous. How did that happen? Well, he caught 70.4 percent of his targets... at 15.9 yards a pop. No other wide receiver in the history of the game has totaled 1,400 yards on 125 or less targets. Bottom line... he needs more targets if he's going to live up to expectations because that's unlikely to happen again. With the defense getting back on track with Danielle Hunter (and adding in free agency), do the Vikings trend back to their run-heavy ways? Adam Thielen is a year older, but the chemistry between him and Kirk Cousins is magical. The sky is the limit for Jefferson with his talent, but will the targets follow? Don't forget this is the same team that held Stefon Diggs to 112 or less targets in 4-of-5 seasons.                                                </div>

Instead, Chubb scored 54.5 more fantasy points than the average running back would've and finished as the RB9 despite playing in just 12 games. The new offense proved to be very beneficial to the run game, though Kareem Hunt's presence does limit Chubb's true ceiling, which should be top-five, but unless he starts to get more targets, he'll remain in the mid-to-low-end RB1 range.                                                </div>

Why didn't it feel amazing? He's part of the Raiders offense, that lacks potency. The targets were what we were chasing, and the targets are what we got. But when you're paying TE2 prices in the second round, you not only need the targets, you need touchdowns. While Waller scored nine of them last year, he scored just three of them in 2019 in the same offense. There's a reason people pay up for Travis Kelce, and while I like Waller, I just don't have that guaranteed Kelce-like production.                                                </div>

The issue is that he's not heavily involved in the passing game, and he topped 94 yards on the ground just twice all of last season, with both of those games coming against the Cowboys. In fact, 28.7 percent of his fantasy points in 2020 were against the Cowboys. I can certainly see Gibson finishing higher than my ranking, but those above him have either (a) a more consistent track record, or (b) less question marks. He scored a touchdown once every 15.5 carries last year, a number that's surely to go up.                                                </div>

Then you get his "boom" performances that carry him to the next level, which is why he finished as the WR7 in half-PPR formats. Tied to Russell Wilson as his No. 1 target, Metcalf is one of the safest bets as a top-12 wide receiver.                                                </div>

Based on the targets he saw last year and where on the field he saw them, he was supposed to finish as the No. 30 wide receiver. That's the opportunity he had. Well, he finished as the No. 12 wide receiver. The year before that, he was supposed to finish as the No. 49 wide receiver but finished No. 15 instead. The addition of Julio Jones will certainly limit his target ceiling, but based on what we've seen to this point, his efficiency should carry him to new heights in 2021.                                                </div>

The Chargers offense is surely going to change with Anthony Lynn out of the picture, so the hope should be that they'll utilize Allen down the field just a tad more to increase his numbers. The good news is that Justin Herbert clearly found his "go-to" receiver, targeting Allen 10-plus times on 10 separate occasions. He's an extremely safe WR2 based on volume alone, though it may be tough for him to get into the top-tier WR1 conversation seeing he's never scored more than eight touchdowns.                                                </div>

The start of 2020 wasn't as generous, but he did average 19.7 touches per game over the first three weeks. Then we saw Giovani Bernard get knocked out of the lineup for a few weeks, and it led to Mixon totaling 27.0 touches per game over the next three weeks before getting hurt. Now that Bernard is gone, are we finally going to get a full season's worth of 20-plus touch games for Mixon? If so, top-five is in the realm of possibilities, especially knowing he'll be more involved in the passing game. Don't sleep on Mixon; he's still a top-10 running back talent-wise.                                                </div>

Because of that, Harris, who takes over as the Steelers' lead back, is someone you want to have on your roster. The Steelers are a team that hasn't been shy about giving running backs 18-plus touches per game with Mike Tomlin at the helm. You don't draft a three-down back like Harris in the first round and put him in some timeshare. I wouldn't be surprised to see him average 20-plus touches per game, which puts him smack dab in the middle of the RB1 conversation.                                                </div>

It's why despite Robinson's lackluster quarterback play, he's been able to finish as a top-12 receiver in back-to-back seasons. The upgrade to Andy Dalton was solid, but if the Bears play Justin Fields, it could be even better. Based on opportunity alone, Robinson should have finished as the WR4 in each of the last two seasons (that's based on how many targets he saw and where he saw them), so there's certainly room for improvement in his finish. Robinson has proven to be a WR1 with bad quarterback play in this same offense, making him one of the safer options as a low-end WR1/high-end WR2.                                                </div>

When Mahomes is on the field, he's producing. The question is this: By drafting him in the early rounds, which running back or wide receiver are you passing on to get him, and is the dropoff more from the quarterback you'd get in the later rounds? If you wanted to draft Mahomes in the third round, you can, but know you're going to need to hit on a player or two later in your draft to make up the ground.                                                </div>

Even better, he was the No. 11 running back while scoring just once during that time. In fact, had he scored one more touchdown, he would've been the No. 6 running back through six weeks. Once they traded for Bell, though, it ruined the stable touches he was getting. With Bell gone and no one significant brought in this offseason, Edwards-Helaire should return to his 18-plus touch role in the offense. The Chiefs have rebuilt their offensive line this year, which should help make life easier on Edwards-Helaire, who did average a solid 4.44 yards per carry his rookie season. Touchdowns are what were lacking, but don't bet on that again in what's likely to be the No. 1 scoring offense in the NFL.                                                </div>

We've watched Fitzpatrick support many fantasy wide receivers throughout his years, and he's been willing to target them relentlessly.

There are suddenly a lot of mouths to feed in Washington, but McLaurin is the clear-cut No. 1 option who should be targeted 140-plus times in 2021 en route to what might be his first top-12 finish.                                                </div>

They snagged Jamaal Williams in free agency and signed him to a two-year deal. Then, they drafted Jermar Jefferson. Then, they brought in Todd Gurley on a free agent visit. While they didn't sign him, it's not promising for Swift's outlook, as they clearly want this to be somewhat of a timeshare. It's not to say timeshare backs can't get into the top-12 conversation - they can, but it requires a lot of scoring opportunities, something we're not expecting from the Lions offense. Swift is an extremely talented football player, but situation and opportunity knock him into clear-cut RB2 territory.                                                </div>

While that's true, it can be argued that Jared Goff's skill-set was tailormade for Woods' skill-set. The 7.1 air yards per target Woods saw in 2020 was the 10th-lowest mark among wide receivers. Meanwhile, Stafford likes to push the ball down the field a bit more. Because of the questions (good or bad), Woods should ultimately be viewed as a mid-to-low-end WR2.                                                </div>

That number is the exact same as Stefon Diggs' career number. It's higher than Terry McLaurin's 48.3 percent. The emergence of CeeDee Lamb may take some of the upside potential away from Cooper, but he's still a great high-end WR2 to have on your fantasy team.                                                </div>

He saw at least six targets in 10-of-12 games despite all the other talent on the roster, which is never a bad thing. The downside is that Godwin never really got into any sort of WR1 groove. He didn't hit the 100-yard mark until Week 17, when Mike Evans was essentially out of the lineup. To be fair, Godwin was playing through a few injuries last year, which may have hindered his upside, but we did watch Mike Evans' relationship with Brady grow as the year went on. On top of that, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski returned to game shape, which will certainly cap everyone's upside. Godwin should be a solid WR2 on a weekly basis, but it's tough seeing him approach top-12 territory without an injury to one of Evans or Brown.                                                </div>

He's now turned in at least 1,000 yards in seven straight seasons with a handful of different quarterbacks, and has scored at least eight touchdowns in five of them. The reason he can't be considered in the elite tier is due to the number of mouths to feed in the Bucs offense. Think about it this way: Despite Chris Godwin being hurt for a while and Antonio Brown not joining the team until mid-season, Evans finished with just 109 targets. He's one of the better WR2's to have in fantasy, but he doesn't come with top-five upside unless there are injuries to those around him.                                                </div>

There were many factors that led to that, particularly the injury to Tarik Cohen, freeing up tons of targets in the passing game. Over the course of Montgomery's short career, he's played 19 games with Cohen and 12 games without him. In the games with Cohen, he averaged 2.32 targets per game. In the 12 games without him, that number rose to 4.92 targets per game. Well, Cohen is back, and the team signed Damien Williams, who's a better receiving back than Montgomery. On top of Cohen missing, the Bears had a ridiculously easy schedule down the stretch, playing against the Packers twice, Lions, Texans, Vikings, and Jaguars to close out the season. Did you know that Montgomery was the RB20 after 10 weeks (prior to starting that schedule)? He's a fine low-end RB2, but don't go about your day thinking you're getting a steal in the fourth round or anything.                                                </div>

Of the eight deep targets he saw in 2020, just one was catchable. Kupp's not a burner by any means, but if he doesn't have splash plays, he's not going to be anything more than a boring PPR asset. There's more to his game than what we've seen, and it's possible that Matthew Stafford unlocks it. He should be treated as a safe, high-floor WR2.                                                </div>

However, if you think he's a breakout candidate to finish as a top-five running back, you're betting against the odds. Among the running backs who finished top-10 last year, just two of them finished there while seeing fewer than 39 targets. Those two running backs were Derrick Henry and Nick Chubb, who averaged 5.4 and 5.6 yards per carry, numbers no one can actually project to hit. They also scored 17 and 12 touchdowns on the ground, propping their numbers up. Dobbins saw just 24 targets last year, a number that's unlikely to move much considering he's in the same offense with the same quarterback, only with more weapons around him. If Dobbins can rush for over 5.0 yards per carry (he did last year) and score double-digit rushing touchdowns (again, hard to project), he's going to finish as a top-10 running back, but not top-five due to the lack of work in the passing game. He's best-suited as your RB2 who has RB1 in his range of outcomes.                                                </div>

In fact, he averaged a career-high 11.3 yards per target during the 2020 season and was the WR13 in half-PPR points per game while ceding plenty of work to up-and-coming superstar Calvin Ridley. It'll be a similar situation in Tennessee, as Jones will now play alongside what might be the next generation's Julio Jones, and that's A.J. Brown. Similar to Atlanta, Jones and Brown are going to cap each other's truly elite ceiling, but as Jones and Ridley proved last year, it's certainly not out of the realm of possibilities that they're both top-12 wide receivers, especially when you factor in Ryan Tannehill's efficiency. Oh, and stop calling Jones injury prone - he's played at least 14 games in seven of the last nine seasons, and has totaled at least 1,394 yards in six of the last seven seasons. You don't do that if you're injury prone.                                                </div>

Calvin Ridley, Stefon Diggs, and... Moore. While the touchdowns were certainly lacking, there's something to be said about this stat and how undervalued Moore may be due to the lack of touchdowns. It was his first year in the offense, while Robby Anderson was brought in because he knew the offense. With Curtis Samuel out of town, we might see Moore in the slot far more often, which wouldn't be a bad thing. He's now finished with 1,175-plus yards in back-to-back seasons. It's only a matter of time before the touchdowns catch up. He's a solid WR2 to roster, who just might have top-12 upside if the touchdowns start to show up.                                                </div>

Allen has done that every single year, and it's translated to fantasy football as well. His percentage of QB1-type games by year: 41.7 - 43.8 - 56.3. He tallied 26-plus fantasy points in eight games last year, which tied for the most in the league. Even better is that he had just one game that was labeled a bust, which lets you know he's a set-it-and-forget-it quarterback who can be played, regardless of opponent. When spending a high-round pick on a quarterback, that's what you need. Allen can start to be considered around the fourth round.                                                </div>

Unfortunately, he was not particularly efficient with them, averaging just 6.4 yards per target. Part of his issues were drops, but Ben Roethlisberger's drop-down mentality certainly didn't help, either. Still, chasing targets at wide receiver is never a bad thing. If Johnson would've averaged just 7.4 yards per target (easily attainable), he would've finished as the WR14. He should be a safe high-floor WR2 with upside for top-12 numbers.                                                </div>

Heck, as them if he was a reliable WR2. The answer would be no, as he finished with WR2 or better numbers just 37.5 percent of the time which was behind players like Diontae Johnson, Curtis Samuel, John Brown, and Jamison Crowder. How's that possible? Because 48.7 percent of his production last year came from just three games. He's going to have massive games, but relying on him as anything more than a volatile WR3 is going to lead to disappointment.                                                </div>

Will the departure of Doug Pederson allow him to shine, or will Nick Sirianni implement a timeshare as well? The depth chart now consists of Sanders, Kerryon Johnson, and Kenneth Gainwell, so this could very well be a Colts-like backfield, which would make sense given that's where Sirianni comes from. Sanders should be treated as a timeshare RB2 who's more talented than most in that conversation.                                                </div>

No other receiver finished higher than No. 18 with fewer yards than Thielen. He's also going to be 31 years old at the start of the season and has a history of back issues, presenting a bit of risk, though he does have a ton of proven production with Kirk Cousins, which can't be ignored.                                                </div>

In fact, Henderson was more efficient than Akers in nearly every category last year, though Akers had the momentum at the end of the season. Will the Rams bring in another running back to compete with Henderson for the starting job? It would seem likely, though for now, Henderson is a rock-solid RB2 with top-10 upside.                                                </div>

His world has been flipped upside down in 2021, as he has a new coaching staff, and more importantly, a new quarterback. The team isn't going to be in scoring position nearly as much, but the good news for Hockenson is that he's now the clear-cut No. 1 target on the team after we watched Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones leave in free agency. Jared Goff has limitations as a quarterback, but his skill-set should actually align with Hockenson's role quite well. It may not be exciting to start Hockenson week-to-week for upside purposes, but he should deliver a rock-solid floor that allows you to start him every week.                                                </div>

Nothing changed except they added more pass catchers. He did get a slight bump in targets (45), though nothing you could rely upon every week. What's changed this offseason? The Raiders decided to pay Kenyan Drake a good chunk of money to come in and share the workload with Jacobs, forcing his fantasy stock to plummet. Drake was essentially the same running back as Jacobs last year, though we've seen him produce in the passing game before. Did the addition of Drake drop Jacobs' price too far, or is this a backfield to simply avoid if possible? I believe he's fallen enough to consider a value as a low-end RB2 who should see be in line for 250-plus touches. The expectations were out of control last year, but if you can get him in the fifth round this year, I'm buying.                                                </div>

In fact, just 10 of those running backs (6.9 percent) have finished worse than RB20. If the Falcons don't add anyone of significance, I'll be moving him up even more.                                                </div>

Four. He's posted 21.3 or more fantasy points in 22-of-30 games during that stretch, which is flat-out ridiculous. Since becoming the starter two years ago, he's posted QB1-type numbers in 76.7 percent of his games. The only other quarterback who's posted higher than 64.8 percent in their career is Patrick Mahomes, who's sitting at 69.6 percent. On top of that, Jackson now got better weapons to throw to, yet some are ranking him as the fourth-best quarterback in fantasy? Not me. Jackson should be in the conversation to be the first quarterback off the board.                                                </div>

He was the WR11 during that time, so a WR1 despite A.J. Green getting tons of work and Tyler Boyd being a big presence. It was a phenomenal start to Higgins' career, and while I loved him as a low-end WR1/high-end WR2 this year, the pick of Ja'Marr Chase at No. 5 overall derailed that excitement. Chase is going to walk in and demand a large chunk of targets right away, as Burrow told the front office that he wanted Chase over Penei Sewell, the stud left tackle. This doesn't mean Higgins is going to go away - he won't. However, it does limit his target ceiling and lowers expectations. He should be valued as a low-end WR2/high-end WR3 with Chase in the picture.                                                </div>

With as many holes as the Jaguars had on the roster, drafting a running back in the first round seemed like a poor choice. However, if he wants to justify his selection, Etienne will be involved early and often. Over the last eight years, there's been just one running back drafted in the first round who didn't net at least 197 touches. Just one of those running backs finished worse than RB28 on the season, and that was Melvin Gordon who failed to score a single touchdown. Etienne's current draft position is RB29 in half-PPR formats. I'll take him there all day at that price. I'm guessing he is a solid RB2 on fantasy teams this year.                                                </div>

He's tallied 2,105 yards and 20 touchdowns over his first three seasons in the league. That's the ninth-most yardage by a tight end in the post-merger era during his first three seasons. You know what other tight ends are on that list? George Kittle, Rob Gronkowski, Jimmy Graham, and Kellen Winslow. Sure, the Ravens went out and added some pass catchers, but Andrews is the go-to option for Lamar Jackson over the middle of the field and in the red zone. Health has been the biggest obstacle for Andrews, but if he's able to stay on the field, he should be the No. 4 tight end off the board.                                                </div>

The major ones being the injuries to George Kittle and Deebo Samuel. There were just four games where the trio were on the field together, and during that time, Aiyuk saw just 21 targets (the lowest of the three) and had 13/189/1 combined in those games. To be fair, it was from Week 4-7, so it was very early in Aiyuk's rookie season, so it's possible he just hadn't earned the trust yet. There's a wide range of outcomes in his projections, going as high as a top-15 wide receiver, but also as low as a wide receiver in the WR30-36 range. You want equity when drafting, so taking Aiyuk as anything more than a WR3 when Kittle and Samuel are healthy is risky.                                                </div>

In fact, rookie tight ends in general have trouble producing. I want to ask you a question: Since 1998, how many tight ends do you think have topped 627 yards in their rookie season? Two of them. Both of those tight ends saw 115-plus targets, a number Pitts isn't likely to see with Arthur Smith as the new head coach. It helps that Julio Jones has left town, but don't forget that ultra-athletic Jonnu Smith saw just 65 targets in Smith's offense just last year, and he wasn't a rookie.                                                </div>

He finished as an RB2 or better in just 56.3 percent of games in PPR formats, which was slightly behind Miles Sanders and slightly ahead of Ronald Jones. His value was arguably better with Chubb on the field last year, so maybe it's a matter of keeping him fresh? Whatever the case, Hunt should be a strong RB3/flex option who has 20-touch upside should Chubb miss time.                                                </div>

What makes that stat even crazier is that his 4.05 percent touchdown rate was below the league average of 4.80 percent, so there was room for more. Of the top eight single-game performances by quarterbacks in 2020, there was only one quarterback on that list twice: Prescott, and he only played four full games. With the receiving weapons he has available, the sky is the limit, though his ankle injury could hamper his rushing upside in 2021. He's certainly someone who's going to throw for a lot of yards and touchdowns, but you need the rushing upside to get into the top-three conversation, so his risk bumps him out of that conversation.                                                </div>

This is great news for Gaskin, who racked up 183 touches in just 10 games last year. Crazy, right? His 18.3 touches per game ranked ninth among running backs. Opportunity is everything, and if he gets that type of opportunity again in 2021 while playing in all the games, he's going to finish as a top-15 running back. The only difference is that the Dolphins added Malcolm Brown in free agency, which could lead to him siphoning some targets away from Gaskin, which would be less than ideal. As of now, Gaskin should probably be considered a solid RB2, though landing him as your RB3/flex would be even better based on the small sample size we have from him in a big role.                                                </div>

Now going to the Giants, who have a bevy of options, including Sterling Shepard, Kadarius Toney, Darius Slayton, Evan Engram, Kyle Rudolph, and Saquon Barkley is going to be tough. To be fair, you don't go out in free agency and sign someone like Golladay to give him five targets per game, but he's not going to get the consistent targets he got in Detroit, and the targets he does get aren't going to be as efficient coming from Daniel Jones.                                                </div>

What we saw Higgins do as a rookie with Joe Burrow was impressive, as he was the WR11 during the eight full games they played together. Keep in mind that was with zero chemistry. Now you insert Chase into the offense, who already has chemistry with Burrow, as they set records at LSU together, and what do we get? I'll acknowledge that Higgins is going to cap Chase's ceiling and that he may not get to top-12 production, but you don't draft Chase at No. 5 overall (over an elite offensive tackle) if you're not going to highlight him in the offense immediately. Heck, even A.J. Green, who averaged 5.0 yards per target, saw 104 targets in this offense last year. Chase should be a WR2 right out of the gate.                                                </div>

I'm going with an extremely low number and say he averages 6.5 targets per game. That sounds more than reasonable, right? Beckham had 7.0 targets per game during the 2020 season before getting hurt and that includes a three-target game against the Steelers. The Browns were also throwing the ball a lot less early in the year as Baker Mayfield was still getting grasp on Kevin Stefanski's playbook. If Beckham gets 6.5 targets per game, that'd put him on pace for 104 targets, which again, is what I'd consider low. There were just 32 receivers in the NFL who hit that number last year, with 24 of them (75 percent) finishing as top-24 receivers and just two finishing worse than WR38. You mean to tell me with Beckham's talent, he can't produce top-24 numbers? There's health risks for sure, but there's also top-five wide receiver upside.                                                </div>

Part of the reason for inconsistency is due to Ben Roethlisberger's volatile performance, but even if he rights the ship in 2021, the bigger part of the problem for Smith-Schuster is the competition he has for targets. Chase Claypool will be entering his sophomore season, Diontae Johnson seemed to figure out his drops as the year went on, and they added Najee Harris and Pat Freiermuth in the first two rounds of the draft. Suddenly, Smith-Schuster might be third in line for targets in this offense. He'll probably finish as a WR3, but I just don't see the upside to drafting him as anything more than a low-end WR3.                                                </div>

He posted WR3 or better type numbers in just 50 percent of the games last year, which was tied with Jamison Crowder and DeVante Parker for 34th among wide receivers. His four-touchdown game in Week 5 really catapulted his numbers at season's end, as he failed to top 59 yards in 11-of-16 games, making him a touchdown-or-bust option most weeks. With Ben Roethlisberger's arm strength seemingly deteriorating by the day, it's tough to see Claypool having a true breakout season in 2021, as he relies on those high value targets more than JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson do. Claypool is an upside pick for sure, but not one I'd bet heavily on.                                                </div>

Despite Kenyan Drake struggling through much of 2020, there were just two games where Edmonds finished with more than eight carries, which is certainly a concern. The Cardinals went out and signed James Conner in free agency, but he's proven to be incapable of staying healthy with a full workload, and it wasn't a pricey contract, so maybe we see Edmonds in a bigger role. Whatever the case, we know he has the pass-catching role locked down, which has value in itself, as he was a flex-type option most weeks (he was an RB3 or better 62.5 percent of the time). This offense is going to score points, so if Edmonds were to get a slight bump in carries, he could make his way into the RB2 conversation. Draft him as an RB3/flex and hope that's the case. Just know that he's still yet to crack 100 carries in a season.                                                </div>

Wilson has never finished worse than QB11 and has finished as a top-three quarterback in four of the last seven seasons.

He finished with more than 15.5 half PPR points just twice, but he also scored fewer than 8.0 half PPR points just four times, offering a level of consistency we hadn't seen out of him. It's because they used him in the possession-style role with a shorter average depth of target than he was getting with the Jets. The Panthers lost Curtis Samuel in free agency, but gained Terrace Marshall in the draft, and will get Christian McCaffrey back from injury, so the loss of Samuel doesn't do a whole lot for projections. D.J. Moore started coming on more as the year went on, though the switch to Sam Darnold could prove to be a good thing for Anderson, who was Darnold's teammate with the Jets. It's still the same offense, and Anderson proved he's able to contribute in a big way, making him somewhat of a safe WR3/4 option with WR2 upside should Darnold favor him as the top option.                                                </div>

Why? His touchdown rate was 9.1 percent in 2020. Every quarterback who's ever finished with a touchdown rate of 8.5 percent or more has regressed the following season. If we dial that number back to Rodgers' career mark of 6.3 percent, which is still elite, he would've finished as the QB10 instead of the QB2 that he did. He doesn't offer mobility anymore and his offense isn't what we'd describe as "pass heavy." Don't forget that many left him for dead after the 2019 season when he posted QB1-type numbers just 31.3 percent of the time. There's probably an in-between here, but that's the issue: I'm unwilling to pay for last year's performance. In reality, he's a safe QB1 who requires an ultra-high touchdown-rate to finish top-five. The same can be said about Tom Brady, who is likely to come a few rounds later in drafts.                                                </div>

Part of that is due to 2020 seeming like the longest year of all-time. But when he does return to the field, the Broncos offense looks quite different than the one that allowed him to rack up 1,112 yards and six touchdowns in 2019. The additions of Jerry Jeudy, KJ Hamler, Melvin Gordon, and Javonte Williams are all massive, as is the emergence of Tim Patrick. Suddenly, it's going to be tough for any receiver on this team to hit 120 targets. But what Sutton has going for him is that he's already shown that he can perform at a high level in the NFL. While I believe Jeudy can as well, we haven't seen that just yet, which gives Sutton the nod in the rankings as a WR3.                                                </div>

Still, he saw 110 targets and finished as the WR35 in half PPR formats. Onto the next obstacle. Ja'Marr Chase is going to be a real thorn in Boyd's side when it comes to volume, as he'll demand more than A.J. Green received last year. All three of the Bengals receivers saw 100-plus targets last year, so it's not like Boyd is going to simply fade away, but he's lost a ton of his upside as the No. 3 option.                                                </div>

The targets that came from Drew Lock were not worth nearly as much as they should've been, and Jeudy owners should be hoping Teddy Bridgewater wins the job. He's someone who's more timing-based than Lock, and that would benefit the route runner that Jeudy is, as you could make a highlight tape of the defenders he made look silly last year, only Lock didn't find him. The quarterback competition weighs heavily on Jeudy's fantasy potential.                                                </div>

Melvin Gordon has one year left on his deal, and it's the same coaching staff that brought him in on a two-year deal worth $16 million. It's likely they continue using Gordon in a timeshare with Williams in the Phillip Lindsay role, which netted 8-16 touches when Gordon was in the lineup. That does give him flex appeal, and if anything were to happen to Gordon, Williams could be a league winner. Treat him as a high-end handcuff, and anything else he gives you is a bonus.                                                </div>

To be handed the starting job just one hour before the game in Week 2, then go on to break the rookie record for passing touchdowns (31) is ridiculous. Now, with that being said, he still finished as the QB9 last year while throwing 595 pass attempts, the fourth most in the legaue. Now that he's got a defensive-minded head coach and a healthy defense, we could see the pass attempts dip a bit in 2021, which would certainly hurt his appeal. The Chargers did increase the talent on the offensive line, but also replaced Hunter Henry with Jared Cook, which is a certainly a downgrade. Herbert should still be a solid low-end QB1, but it's tough to see him finishing as a top-five option in 2021.                                                </div>

Well, he's probably going to finish better than where I have him ranked at the end of the season, but just because he finishes as the WR24 (hypothetically), it doesn't necessarily mean he's the 24th best receiver to roster. Through 22 career games, Samuel has never hit the "boom" mark of 25 PPR points. On top of that, there are suddenly a lot of mouths to feed in the 49ers pass attack. He's a solid player with a decent floor, but he won't be the reason you win a fantasy championship. You can take him as a stable WR3, or shoot for someone with a higher ceiling/lower floor.                                                </div>

The issue stems from his quarterback, as the targets are simply not that valuable, because 93 of them (what Fant saw) is more than enough to be a reliable fantasy asset. Unfortunately, we don't know if Drew Lock will still be the quarterback, and the Broncos have Courtland Sutton returning to the lineup, which will surely cut into Fant's target share. On top of that, the team seemed to like using both Fant and Albert Okwuegbunam prior to Okwuegbunam's injury last year, which is another ding on Fant's fantasy stock. He's fine, but unless there's a change at quarterback, he's nothing you can't live without.                                                </div>

Not only is Michel healthy, but the Patriots also decided to draft Rhamondre Stevenson in the fourth round of this year's draft, which just adds another body to the mix. I like Harris as a player, but as someone who topped 16 touches just twice last year with little competition and no role in the passing game, you should aim higher for your RB2/3 option.                                                </div>

If Trevor Lawrence turns out to be the real deal, Chark can be the 2021 version of Tee Higgins when he was with Joe Burrow (was the No. 11 wide receiver in eight full games with Burrow). Chark already flashed WR1 potential in 2019 when he racked up 73 receptions for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns with the combination of Gardner Minshew and Nick Foles, so why can't he be more with Lawrence? The coaching staff is a big question mark, but you don't draft Lawrence to run the ball 40 times per game. Chark comes with some risk but even more upside.                                                </div>

Robinson accounted for 289 of them, or 87.0 percent, a number that doesn't really exist in today's NFL. He averaged 4.46 yards per carry, 5.73 yards per target, and scored 10 total touchdowns, which is solid, though nothing special. Enter Urban Meyer, who said they wanted to add depth/competition at the running back position. After adding Carlos Hyde, you knew Robinson would lose some touches, but it wasn't that much of a concern. After drafting Travis Etienne in the first round, it's definitely a concern. Robinson would be lucky to earn a 50/40/10 split with Etienne and Hyde, with Robinson being the 40 of the group. If we knock Robinson's touches into the 10-12 per game territory, you're not going to be trusting him as anything more than a shaky flex option.                                                </div>

The only player standing in his way of 15-plus touches is Tevin Coleman, who's played just 22-of-32 games the last two seasons. On top of that, he's never been efficient when asked to carry a heavy workload. Carter reminded me of Justin Forsett while scouting him. He does everything well, and though he's undersized, that shouldn't stop him from getting plenty of opportunity, especially in the passing game. The Jets are no longer an Adam Gase-led team. There's value to be had in this offense, and Carter is one of the best late-round values in fantasy football.                                                </div>

He's turned 282 career carries into 1,590 yards and 11 touchdowns. But that's the issue, he's never healthy. There's a reason he's 29 years old and has just 282 carries on his frame. Have the 49ers lost patience? They traded up to draft Trey Sermon in the third round, which could indicate they're ready to move on from Mostert, or it could be them ensuring they have a high-quality backup for if/when he gets injured. Mostert tallied at least 14 carries in 5-of-8 starts last year, which is more than enough to get into RB2 territory with his efficiency, but you can't draft him as such when injuries/Sermon are factored in. He's not someone you can confidently draft as a starter for your fantasy team because there's so much unknown. However, if he gets the job back, this is a pick that can make a difference in fantasy leagues. The 49ers have one of the easiest schedules in the league, so if they let Mostert get rolling, he's unlikely to slow down.                                                </div>

In 20 games with non-Watson quarterbacks, Fuller has averaged 6.0 targets, 3.1 receptions, 38.7 yards, and 0.10 touchdowns, which is a far cry from his 6.5 targets, 4.5 receptions, 70.6 yards, and 0.67 touchdowns per game with Watson under center. Can Tua Tagovailoa take a step forward in his career in 2021? Sure, but he's not going to be Watson, and there are suddenly tons of options for him to throw to, which means Fuller is going to have to fight for his target share. There's more risk than you'd like with Fuller, who's also had his fair share of injuries throughout his career. Getting him as a WR4 would be ideal, as you aren't relying on him for production week-in and week-out.                                                </div>

That's not quite what happened, as they continually wanted to involve Phillip Lindsay. After letting him walk in free agency, they snagged Mike Boone, which was a downgrade from Lindsay. Okay... but that wasn't it. They drafted Javonte Williams at the top of the second round, a running back who'll certainly compete for touches immediately. Gordon isn't going to simply go away making the money he is, but he's also not likely going to get the 16.5 touches per game he was in 2020. There's also a possible suspension coming Gordon's way for a DUI incident last year, which needs to be factored into his fantasy stock. He's not someone you should be relying on for anything more than RB3/flex production.                                                </div>

Head coach Ron Rivera said a lightbulb went off for him, and it led to him finishing as the No. 3 tight end through his final 11 games, behind only Travis Kelce and Darren Waller. The issue with expecting that continue into 2021? Well, there are many variables. The Football Team went out and acquired Ryan Fitzpatrick - who's never targeted tight ends heavily - as well as Curtis Samuel in free agency, Dyami Brown in the draft, and they've vowed to give Antonio Gibson more work this year. Volume is everything for tight ends, and if we can't guarantee it for Thomas, he's not worthy of an early-round pick. There's still certainly an avenue for 100 targets; it's just not guaranteed. Thomas should be considered a mid-to-low-end TE1.                                                </div>

He's going to be 44 years old when the season starts, which brings us back to the conversation, "When does he fall off?" I'm done trying to predict that, but it must be factored into his price in fantasy drafts. Was last year a best-case scenario? He finished as the QB8 even with those numbers, as mobility is almost neccesary to finish higher in today's game. Because of that, Brady shouldn't be drafted as anything more than a low-end QB1 with a limited ceiling.                                                </div>

It seems like a foregone conclusion that Ertz will be off the team soon, which clears a path for Goedert to be among the league leaders in targets for a tight end. It's a new offense, but Nick Sirianni comes from the Frank Reich tree, which has a history of producing tight end production. Goedert may not be a can't-miss tight end, but if there's someone who has top-five upside without being drafted there, it's him.                                                </div>

The others are Julio Jones, Mike Evans, DeAndre Hopkins, Davante Adams, Brandin Cooks, and Amari Cooper. However, the issue is that Landry isn't the "sexy" pick that everyone wants because he's never going to be the reason you win a championship. With Odell Beckham due back to the lineup, it's only going to cap his upside even more, and therefore supress his ADP. You need balance on your fantasy roster and Landry can provide stability that not many have. Just keep your weekly expectations in check.                                                </div>

The Eagles were severely lacking wide receiver talent last year, and it led to them trading up to take Smith to solidify their go-to receiver for Jalen Hurts. Smith was the most pro-ready receiver in the draft, though some are concerned with his lack of weight. Even though every college knew he was getting the ball, they couldn't stop him, and it's not like Alabama plays weak opponents. He dominated everyone he came across. As someone who should get a consistent six-plus targets per game, Smith should be a WR3, even in his rookie season.                                                </div>

Look, he's not going to surpass Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, but he'll be closer than some think.                                                </div>

He also flashed upside with a 37.8-point outburst in Week 15 against the Cardinals. The downside is that it was a small sample size, and Hurts appeared to get worse every time out. Even then, it's still a small sample size. There's a new coaching staff, along with a new No. 1 receiver, but if what we saw from Hurts in 2020 was his floor, we're in for a treat in 2021. If he can hone in and improve his accuracy numbers from 2020, there's legitimate top-six quarterback upside.                                                </div>

The 49ers have one of the softest schedules in the league among running backs, so if we start hearing whispers that Sermon will start right out of the gate, he should shoot up draft boards. For now, he should be viewed as one of the best bench stashes in fantasy football.                                                </div>

The difference? Stafford hasn't had a play-caller to bring out the best in him for quite some time and it's crushed his fantasy upside. Welcome to L.A. where you'll be working with Sean McVay, whose offense has been handicapped with Jared Goff under center. Could this be the change Stafford needed to reach the next level? The only concern would be that the Rams defense is so good, we won't get the volume needed for a pocket passer like Stafford. He has upside to finish as a top-10 option, but knowing his limitations as a rusher (with back problems), he likely won't reach much higher than the QB8-QB10 range.                                                </div>

Chark on the Jaguars depth chart. Suddenly, the Jaguars have a new play-caller, a proven veteran receiver (Marvin Jones), and a first-round running back (Travis Etienne) they're calling a wide receiver. This has created some doubt in the role that Shenault will play under Urban Meyer. There's upside in selecting him as a bench receiver, though, as Trevor Lawrence should be a massive upgrade at quarterback, and it's not like Chark/Jones haven't dealt with injuries over the last couple years (Jones is also getting up there in age). Shenault is purely an upside pick that you stash on your bench until you find out just how he's being used.                                                </div>

The issue, however, is that he's being reunited with offensive coordinator Scott Turner, who couldn't get the most out of Samuel during the 2019 season. While Samuel saw a career-high 106 targets that year, he averaged a minuscule 5.9 yards per target while used in an incorrect role. Will that change? It's tough to say, but Terry McLaurin, J.D. McKissic, Antonio Gibson, and Logan Thomas are all competition for targets with his new team. Samuel should have plenty of manufactured touches, but don't automatically assume he's as valuable as he was in 2020.                                                </div>

He scored 61.2 more fantasy points than the average tight end would've, pushing him all the way up to the No. 3 tight end on the season. That's a 15-spot leap over opportunity. No other tight end jumped more than six spots than their opportunity. To be fair, that screams regression, and that will happen on a per-target basis, but we can't forget it was Tonyan's first season in a full-time role, so there's some natural career progression. The chemistry between him and Rodgers can't be denied, either, as he caught 88.1 percent of his targets, a new record for tight ends. Tonyan isn't going to see 100-plus targets like the top-tier tight ends, but he's one of the best bets for a touchdown each and every week, which is all you can ask for when taking a tight end in the later rounds.                                                </div>

Brown. He signed with the Jets in free agency and figures to be their go-to receiver, though there are suddenly tons of mouths to feed in New York. The Jets also added Keelan Cole in free agency, drafted Elijah Moore in the second round, and managed to restructure Jamison Crowder's contract to keep him in town. On top of all that, they have a rookie quarterback under center, which presents another obstacle. Davis is likely to be the leader in targets, but he may not have enough consistency to be a weekly WR3. Ideally, you draft him as a WR4 to play in spots.                                                </div>

He finished with more than 52 rushing yards just once all year, and that came in Week 2 against the Panthers. Fournette's primary source of fantasy points in 2020 was via the passing game, as he saw 47 targets in 13 games. Unfortunately, the Bucs added Gio Bernard, who's a much better receiver out of the backfield. Knowing that Bernard is the more reliable third-down option and that Ronald Jones is probably the better two-down option, that leaves Fournette in no man's land. He's not someone you're going to want to start every week.                                                </div>

That's the good news. The bad news is that the Texans are a team that legitimately might lose every game in 2021, as they've been stripped down and look like a roster of replacements. They've also added Mark Ingram, Phillip Lindsay, and Rex Burkhead to the backfield, which presents all sorts of issues. If Deshaun Watson were going to play, we'd dig into this backfield a little deeper, but with Watson out of the picture for the foreseeable future, this is not a backfield you want to be associated with.                                                </div>

Five of those games came at the end of the 2019 season when Gerald Everett was either out of the lineup or very limited. Well, Everett has been signed by the Seahawks, and the next man up on the Rams depth chart to fill his spot is Bryce Hopkins, who's seen as many targets as I have in an NFL uniform (none). Eliminating Everett's targets and upgrading Higbee's quarterback is the recipe for success, and it shouldn't shock anyone to see Higbee finish as a top-10 tight end in 2021.                                                </div>

He also happens to have one of the brightest young stars as his quarterback with little else on the depth chart outside of Keenan Allen. Health has been the biggest question mark for Williams, but once you're outside the top-40 wide receivers, there's hardly guaranteed production on the board, so take the upside.                                                </div>

While operating as Le'Veon Bell's backup, Conner had pep in his step and performed like an RB1 when given the opportunity. But once he took over as the team's No. 1 running back, injuries continually piled up, letting his body know he wasn't capable of being that guy. Many are assuming that Chase Edmonds is the No. 1 running back in this offense, and while I believe that's the case, there's a non-zero percent chance that Conner takes over the Kenyan Drake role from last season that netted 239 carries and 31 targets. There's a reason the Cardinals signed him in free agency, so he will have a role, but the question is "how big?" He might be worth a late-round pick just in case he does get the Drake role (or even 80 percent of it).                                                </div>

That's not exactly living up to expectations. He is apparently on track to be back in the lineup for Week 1, but his mobility might be limited, especially to start the year, which will put a damper on his fantasy upside. The good news is that the Bengals improved the offensive line this offseason, as well as drafting Ja'Marr Chase at No. 5 overall based on Burrow's recommendation. He now has one of the best trio of wide receivers in the game, paired with a rebuilding defense, which should be the recipe for plenty of pass attempts. But again, dial back expectations because of his mobility. Burrow is best-served as a high-end QB2 in fantasy this year.                                                </div>

They both finished between 3.9 and 4.0 yards per carry, both scored double-digit rushing touchdowns, and both were extremely limited in the passing game. The Raiders have continually given guys like DeAndre Washington, Jalen Richard, and Devontae Booker work alongside Jacobs over the last two years, so Drake is going to get mixed in quite heavily, and my guess would be that the passing game is where he gets most of it. You may not remember, but Drake was considered a solid third-down back early in his career with the Dolphins, and has two seasons with 50-plus catches on his NFL resume. It's tough to see him eating into Jacobs' carry totals a whole lot, especially after the way he looked with the Cardinals in 2020, but he should offer low-upside flex value due to his work in the passing game.                                                </div>

Unfortunately, he suffered an injury early in the season and was never able to wrestle the starting gig away from Devin Singletary. He did finish with at least 12 carries in three of the last four games, which leaves room for hope, but he also saw just three targets in those four games combined, which makes him extremely touchdown-dependent. When Josh Allen is the primary goal-line back, that presents an issue. Without an injury to Singletary, it's tough to see Moss being anything more than a touchdown-dependent RB3/4 option.                                                </div>

It's possible he misses the first 4-6 games based on the timeline he received. It did seem like everyone forget he was the consensus No. 1 wide receiver just a year ago. The big question is: Who is his quarterback once he returns? If it's Hill, there should be a slight downgrade, but don't forget what Thomas did in the four Hill games last year: 9/104/0, 4/50/0, 9/105/0, and 8/84/0. Those are rock-solid numbers, though the touchdowns were obviously not there. Right now, I'm expecting Thomas to miss at least four games, which moves him down into WR4 territory. If you're able to stay afloat the first month of the season, snagging Thomas in the middle rounds might be a winning strategy.                                                </div>

While that's firm RB2 territory, he finished as an RB2 or better in just 43.8 percent of his games, tied with Chase Edmonds. He clearly has a role in this offense, though it's a bit reliant on gamescript, as Jonathan Taylor is the clear early-down back, while Hines is the preferred back in passing situations. If they give Taylor more work in the passing game this year, it's coming at the expense of Hines, and knowing Taylor's ADP, drafters expect that increase for Taylor. Even going back to 2019, Hines was an RB3 or better just 43.8 percent of the time, which is more in line for how you should feel about him in 2021. He's just an emergency flex option.                                                </div>

Williams isn't a bad running back by any means, but it's more about the offense and their want to use a timeshare at running back. It's the same reason D'Andre Swift is falling into middling RB2 range of drafts - it's not because of his talent. Even if Swift were to miss time, the Lions would likely bring in another running back to share the workload. They already brought Todd Gurley in for a visit, so they clearly haven't taken their minds off adding another running back. Not just that, but it's also likely to be a low-scoring offense, which just doesn't give you a lot of upside/potential.                                                </div>

Sure, he's now 31 years old, but he's also coming off 1,757 yards and 18 touchdowns over the last two seasons, and that was while missing three full games. The Jaguars and their new coaching staff sought him out in free agency and paid him $7 million per year, so he's not likely going to be "just a mentor" to the young receivers. It is tough to see him being a consistent producer, however, as D.J. Chark, Laviska Shenault, and Travis Etienne are all going to be heavily targeted as well.                                                </div>

That's changed as we head into 2021, as the Dolphins have added Will Fuller and Jaylen Waddle to the arsenal. Despite the lack of options last year, Gesicki saw just 85 targets. There is a new offensive coordinator, which can certainly shake things up, but the additions of Fuller and Waddle reduce the need for Gesicki's athleticism, and he's not a possession-style tight end. His upside is capped, and his floor might be in jeopardy, too.                                                </div>

On top of that, Lawrence has great mobility and is likely to rush for 400-plus yards and a handful of touchdowns on the ground.

In those games, he's averaged 43.5 fewer yards, 0.13 fewer touchdowns, and 0.07 more interceptions, which may not sound like a lot, but it all adds up to 2.9 fewer fantasy points per game, and it's not as if Ryan was an elite fantasy starter with Jones. On top of that, Ryan has a new head coach, and one whose offenses have ranked 30th and 31st in pass attempts over the last two years. Ryan is going to be a streamer in 2021, so don't draft him as your every-week option.                                                </div>

Yeah, we all know how that story ended. Singletary has produced RB2 or better numbers just 35.7 percent of the time, which is extremely poor for a running back who's averaged 14.2 opportunities per game. The Bills don't run the ball a whole lot, and it's extremeley likely that Zack Moss is the better early-down back who will get more goal-line carries. Singletary is a very low upside pick late in drafts who's best served as a bye week flex-type player.                                                </div>

While that might be high expectations, the opportunity was there. Philip Rivers turned out to be better than most expected, though Pittman finished with more than 66 yards just once all year, and topped 46 yards just three times. He scored just once, which surely didn't help his year-end totals, but with Campbell back in the mix, he isn't a surefire pick to gain a whole lot of targets. Hilton was re-signed, Zach Pascal out-produced him, and Carson Wentz has traditionally favored his targets over the middle of the field. Pittman should lead this team in touchdowns with his large frame, but he's likely to be a bit too touchdown-dependent to trust as anything more than a boom-or-bust WR4.                                                </div>

No matter who is under center for the Bears (it'll be Justin Fields before long), they'll be an upgrade for Mooney, who finished with 98 targets his rookie season, meaning he took over Taylor Gabriel's role and then some. With Anthony Miller now gone, it's likely we see Mooney with a similar, if not bigger role in 2021. He's not likely to see a consistently high target share with Allen Robinson on the field, but with his field-stretching ability, he doesn't need double-digit targets to make a splash in fantasy. He'll be worth even more when Fields takes the starting job.                                                </div>

The signing of Hunter Henry hurt his projection a bit, but the drafting of Mac Jones improved it a bit because once he takes over as the starter, this team will throw a lot more. Once you get outside the top five tight ends, you're chasing upside, and Smith has plenty of it.                                                </div>

That amounts to 10.9 touches per game, which is enough for most running backs to be considered a flex-type start. The issue with Dillon is that he's not likely going to be involved in the passing game, as Aaron Jones is a far superior receiver, and the Packers do throw quite a bit on the goal-line when Aaron Rodgers is under center. Dillon is essentially someone who's a touchdown-dependent flex option most weeks, but offers legitimate RB1 upside if Jones were to miss any time.                                                </div>

Even if Smith received all of Rudolph's departed targets, that's no guarantee to net top-12 production. Their defense should get back on track this year, and it's not like Jefferson will become less involved. You shouldn't be paying for top-12 production, but rather hoping for it.                                                </div>

But on a week-to-week basis, you're never going to say Cousins is a top-12 quarterback. He's a rock-solid QB2 in Superflex formats, but he's just a streamer in 1QB leagues. I'd rather draft someone like Trevor Lawrence for upside.                                                </div>

He likely won't see the 100 targets he saw in 2020, though his targets should be a bit more impactful.

Someone who's never heavily used, but one who kills it with every opportunity he gets. He's averaged at least 5.0 yards per carry in each of his three seasons with the Ravens. Now that Mark Ingram is gone, it's possible we see Edwards top his 144-carry career mark from 2020, but the real issue is that he's obsolete in the passing game, totaling just 23 targets over 43 games. He's never caught more than two passes in a game. If J.K. Dobbins were to miss time, Edwards would be a solid RB2 in fantasy, though he'd be a bit more touchdown-dependent than most in that range.                                                </div>

In fact, he was supposed to finish as the TE5 based on his opportunity. It's no surprise the Giants felt the need to go out and add playmakers this offseason. On top of adding Kenny Golladay, Kyle Rudolph, and Kadarius Toney, they'll also get Saquon Barkley back, which will surely cut into Engram's target share. He's no longer an every-week starter in fantasy.                                                </div>

That certainly helps project him for a quick start to his career, as does the absence of Will Fuller in Week 1 as he serves the remainder of his suspension. Tagovailoa talked about his pass catchers not gaining separation last year, but that shouldn't be an issue with Waddle. Even when Fuller joins the lineup, it might not be a bad thing for Waddle, as he should slide into the slot where he'll be matched up with nickel cornerbacks and safeties. Waddle might be someone who produces quicker than most rookies due to his familiarity with his quarterback.                                                </div>

Well, one of those games he played was with Teddy Bridgewater under center, where Murray rushed for 119 yards and two touchdowns against the tough Bears defense. He's getting up there in age, but should still present borderline RB1 potential behind a great offensive line should Kamara miss any time.                                                </div>

It's not just Gibson, either. The Football Team also signed Curtis Samuel in free agency, a player that's used in a hybrid role who gets plenty of intermittent targets, as well as a handful of carries per game. While McKissic was a hidden gem in PPR formats last year, it appears his role is shrinking in this offense. As someone who relies on volume to produce, McKissic is more of a passing-down handcuff to Gibson.                                                </div>

He's averaged 4.78 yards per carry during that time, so it wasn't just volume.

Cam Newton wasn't throwing touchdowns, and he was stealing all the touchdowns near the goal line. Not that White gets many opportunities around the goal line, as he only totaled 35 carries last year, but the lack of touchdowns destroyed his usability. If Newton is still under center in 2021, White's going to have similar problems. If Mac Jones were to take over as the starter, it might inject some life back into White, as the offense would certainly be passing the ball more.                                                </div>

On top of that, he had Ryan Fitzpatrick breathing down his neck. Fast forward to 2021 where Fitzpatrick is gone, and the Dolphins have added Will Fuller and Jaylen Waddle to his stable of pass catchers. If his injuries really limited him in 2020, we could see an explosion in 2021 with the firepower they have at wide receiver, but don't automatically assume that.                                                </div>

Outside of Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, they don't have any reliable targets, and Trautman did well with his opportunity last year. After parting ways with both Emmanuel Sanders and Jared Cook, there's suddenly a lot of opportunity available for him. There would certainly be less appeal if Taysom Hill were the starter, but many are expecting Jameis Winston to be under center come Week 1. Whatever the case, Trautman makes for a great late-round pick where you'll find out exactly what you have in the first game of the season. There's a scenario where he finishes as a top-10 tight end, especially now that we know Michael Thomas is going to miss time at the start of the season.                                                </div>

He's always been someone who benefitted from a lot of volume in an offense with not a whole lot of options to throw to. Based on the opportunity he had last year and where it took place on the field, Henry scored 18.7 fewer fantasy points than he was expected to, which ranked as the fourth-worst number in football. He's now the No. 2 tight end on a Patriots team that figures to have Cam Newton under center for at least the first few games. Henry is nothing more than a streamer in 2021, and to be honest, I don't anticipate there being many weeks to use him without an injury ahead of him on the depth chart.                                                </div>

For whatever reason, Andy Reid hasn't used Hardman in a full-time role, which meant he saw fewer than five targets in 11-of-16 games last year. Now that Sammy Watkins is gone, does his role grow, or does Reid continue to use him sparingly. If we hear that Hardman is being taken off special teams, it would be a massive boost to his stock. There's certainly upside with him, but we need Reid to have a change of heart for it to be recognized.                                                </div>

Did it take time to develop chemistry with Philip Rivers? If so, are we going to experience a similar slow start in 2021 with Carson Wentz? On top of the chemistry concern, he has to contend with youngsters Parris Campbell and Michael Pittman, who are both another year into their NFL career, and likely ready to take on bigger roles. Hilton's upside feels severely capped, so it's best to treat him as someone you play through bye weeks rather than someone you rely on week-in and week-out.                                                </div>

The game seemed to come easy to him, which is the same thing I said about Tee Higgins. They're different players, but some are just born to play this game. So, to hear about Moore tearing up the offseason workouts, it didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was them re-working Jamison Crowder's contract to keep him with the team. His presence is going to be an issue for Moore's ceiling in his rookie year. The hope for Moore is that they'll use him in a Curtis Samuel-type role where they manufacture touches for him to give fantasy managers weekly usability. He's certainly someone to keep an eye on.                                                </div>

The Falcons ran 3WR sets 61 percent of the time last year, which allowed Gage to get on the field more often. Arthur Smith's offense in Tennessee last year ran 3WR sets just 38 percent of the time, the second-lowest mark in football. That obviously presents a problem for Gage, as does the arrival of Kyle Pitts, who'll be utilized as a receiver at times. Some may wonder if the loss of Julio Jones opens things up for him. Yes, it will likely net him more targets, but targets on the perimeter haven't been the same for Gage, as he works best from the slot. The Falcons could very well start Tajae Sharpe over him in 2WR sets.                                                </div>

This highlights the fact that they still value Graham with his $10 million salary. With Graham still around, it's going to be tough for Kmet to become an every-week starter.

He was a bit slot out of the gate, but was ultimately able to finish as the No. 8 tight end in 2020. That's not a huge accomplishment or anything, as he still failed to record more than 48 yards in 11-of-16 games, and that's despite Chris Godwin missing time to injury, and Antonio Brown not joining the team until midseason. We also can't forget about O.J. Howard, who had more production and targets than Gronkowski when he tore his Achilles. Gronkowski will certainly offer some streamable weeks, but relying on him as your every-week tight end would be a mistake with all the mouths they have to feed in Tampa Bay.                                                </div>

When the Giants signed Kenny Golladay in free agency, it surely lowered the target ceiling for Shepard, but again, he was going to be the starting slot receiver. After that, they went and drafted Kadarius Toney in the first round, a receiver who's essentially slot-only. Will he start over Shepard right away? Will they move Shepard opposite Golladay and send Darius Slayton to the bench? We don't know those answers right now, but there's certainly less appeal with Shepard now that all these new faces are around.                                                </div>

Whatever the case, Bernard is going to be nothing more than a third-down back who might help during bye weeks in PPR formats.                                                </div>

That didn't happen with Ruggs. There wasn't a game in 2020 where he saw more than five targets or caught more than three receptions. We did see the Raiders move on from Nelson Agholor, but he was quickly replaced by John Brown. It's no secret that Brown has struggled to stay healthy, which could be the door Ruggs needs to get more targets. He shouldn't need an injury to get targets, but if this Raiders coaching staff told us anything last year, it's that they don't know how to best utilize Ruggs.                                                </div>

If you need any proof of that, just look at Dalton Schultz last year. He was Jarwin's backup, took over in Week 2, and played with a backup quarterback for almost a full season. Still, he finished as the TE14 in fantasy football while having the 13th-most expected fantasy points. With Prescott back under center and Jarwin back to full health, there is breakout potential here. At the very worst, Jarwin will be a streaming-worthy tight end on multiple occasions.                                                </div>

Sure, Jones didn't have top-tier pass catchers last year, but Sterling Shepard, Darius Slayton, and Golden Tate were competent. The Giants seem to believe Jones was simply lacking weapons, so they went out and signed Kenny Golladay and Kyle Rudolph, and then drafted Kadarius Toney in the first round. Based on what we've seen from Jones to this point, it's tough saying he's anything more than a boom-or-bust quarterback who'll need some rushing totals in order to make him streamer-worthy.                                                </div>

With tight ends, you need someone who'll consistently get 5-6 targets per game, or you're streaming the position. With Beckham back and Bryant ascending in his career, you're not going to get a consistent 5-6 targets per game out of Hooper, making him a streamer.                                                </div>

In those games, he's delivered QB1-type performances just 14 times (43.8 percent), and a "boom" performance just one time (3.1 percent). I'd rather take shots on the rookie quarterbacks who might not start out of the gate, as Carr certainly wouldn't be your QB1.                                                </div>

It may have been a combination of all three things, though the other two have changed this offseason, as Nick Sirianni is now the head coach, and Jalen Hurts is now the quarterback. The downside is that the Eagles drafted Devonta Smith in the first round and he's immediately going to become the No. 1 target for Hurts, which puts Reagor into competition with Dallas Goedert as the No. 2 option in this offense. If Hurts pans out, Reagor could be a value later in drafts, though he may be a bit more boom/bust than you'd like due to his inconsistent targets.                                                </div>

He bounced back in a big way with the Raiders, averaging 10.9 yards per target, which ranked fifth among wide receivers who saw 60-plus targets. Unfortunately, he'll have to prove it again with another franchise. If Cam Newton is under center, we saw what that does to wide receivers in 2020, but knowing it's possible that Mac Jones starts gives us hope for Agholor with the Patriots. But as of now, it seems Newton will get the gig to start the season, meaning Agholor may not pay dividends right out of the gate.                                                </div>

Looking at their Boom, Bust, and Everything In Between numbers, they're nearly identical, as both posted RB2 or better numbers 39 percent of the time, though Cohen has delivered RB3 or better numbers 61 percent of the time to Sproles' 56 percent. Cohen is still in the same offense that gave him those numbers and with what should be a much better quarterback (regardless of Dalton or Fields) under center, leading a higher scoring offense. He's never going to be someone who wins you a fantasy league single-handedly, but he's someone who can certainly contribute in your flex spot, and he costs next to nothing.                                                </div>

Prior to playing with Drew Brees, Cook had never topped six touchdowns in a season, so dialing back expectations would be wise. He could be a solid streamer in projected shootouts, but relying on him every week wouldn't be wise.                                                </div>

The Jets are head over heels in love with Elijah Moore, who projects as someone who'll play quite a few slot snaps. They also went out and snagged Corey Davis in free agency, so he'll be their top receiver. You mustn't forget that Adam Gase is no longer the head coach, and Sam Darnold is no longer the quarterback. Removing those two is bad for Crowder's production, as both loved the slot very much. The Jets suddenly have a crowded depth chart at wide receiver, meaning Crowder might not even play a full-time role.                                                </div>

That makes him someone to largely ignore in redraft leagues. But long-term, there's plenty to like. "He's good, sure, but the offense is run-first and doesn't have a lot of volume. He's a rookie wide receiver, they take time to develop. He's not the No. 1 target on his team." We said those exact same things about Justin Jefferson last year and look what happened. From the moment I started watching Bateman's film, I was instantly reminded of Keenan Allen. A receiver who may not be an elite athlete, but one who continually got open due to intelligence and route running. When he's healthy, he should be lined up all over the formation, including the slot, becoming Lamar Jackson's favorite target as a possession-style receiver while Marquise Brown plays the field-stretching role. There's a scenario where Bateman is an every-week WR2/3 option once he returns from his injury.                                                </div>

He's seen 119 targets over his first three seasons combined, which have amounted to 80 receptions, 1,109 yards, and 14 touchdowns, so the efficiency has been top-notch. Did Drew Brees not have the arm to push the ball down the field anymore? If Jameis Winston is the quarterback, Smith may very well be a sleeper in fantasy drafts, though that optimism would die quickly if Taysom Hill were named the starter. It did boost Smith's stock to learn that Michael Thomas would be missing time to start the season, as that makes Smith the WR1 on the team.                                                </div>

He's also going to play with one of the best young quarterbacks in football, though he's clearly behind Stefon Diggs in the pecking order. The move to sign Sanders was odd considering how well Gabriel Davis played last year, but the Bills do run the second-most 4WR sets in football, so they'll be on the field together at times. But still, Sanders is now 34 years old and is likely in Buffalo to provide a reliable receiver in a pinch rather than one who'll pop back into the WR3 conversation. He is what he is at this point, which is a low-upside bye week filler.                                                </div>

Still, he produced a 1,000-yard season in 2019, and finished with 70-plus yards in five of the nine games he did play in 2020. Now going to Las Vegas where there is no clear-cut No. 1 wide receiver, Brown could have a Nelson Agholor-like 2021 season where he essentially goes undrafted, but winds up being a borderline WR3 most weeks, but he needs to stay healthy in order for that to happen.                                                </div>

The issue from a fantasy standpoint is that the Ravens' efficiency in the red zone with Lamar Jackson under center has led to fewer field goal attempts. After averaging 39 field-goal attempts per season from 2015-2018, Tucker has attempted just 29 field goals in each of the past two seasons. His increase in extra-point attempts (he's averaged 56 extra-point attempts the last two seasons after averaging just 33 the four prior seasons) just isn't enough to make up the difference. Still, even if Tucker is down from his peak, he remains a locked-in top-10 kicker and the safest option on the board. He should be one of the first few taken at the position, even if his upside isn't quite as high anymore.                                                </div>

Still, there's no competition for targets among the tight ends, and with Arthur Smith out of town, it's very likely the Titans throw the ball more in 2021. The issue with thinking Firkser could be a breakout tight end is due to the fact that he's just 6-foot-2 and 246 pounds, which is not very big for a tight end, and it's shown in the red zone, as he's scored just three career touchdowns on 97 targets. There's going to be streaming opportunities when the Titans are playing in a projected shootout, but he's not someone you want to rely on week-in and week-out.                                                </div>

It's now or never and he's getting his shot in Joe Brady's pass-friendly offense with some tremendous weapons. The one issue that remains, however, is that his offensive line is brutal. Despite that, Teddy Bridgewater was able to post 19-plus fantasy points in seven games last year, and that was while throwing just 15 touchdowns. The Panthers traded him for essentially nothing, and then passed on Justin Fields and Mac Jones in the draft, so they clearly believe Darnold can be their long-term answer. I don't want to hold it against Darnold that he had to play for Adam Gase in two of his first three seasons, but at the same time, he's thrown more than two touchdowns in just three of his 38 career games to this point and offers minimal fantasy upside on the ground. Because of that, it's hard to see him as a true breakout performer this year, but he should be a great target in Superflex/2QB leagues because he's not going to lose the job anytime soon, so you have an every-week starter.                                                </div>

Unfortunately, he wasn't particularly efficient with them, finishing 15th in fantasy scoring. The reason was because he lacked upside and never scored more than 13.7 half PPR points all season. That's going to happen when you're the No. 4 option behind the three wide receivers. Now we add Najee Harris to this offense, and suddenly, Ebron may not even get the volume he did last year, and we haven't even talked about the addition of Pat Friermuth in the second round of the draft. Ebron should be labeled as a streamer, and not an every-week option.                                                </div>

The question is whether he'll get the opportunity to showcase his talents in Kliff Kingsbury's offense. We already know DeAndre Hopkins is getting his share, and they've been talking up A.J. Green's involvement, which means Moore would have to surpass Christian Kirk in order to see the field in 3WR sets, which seems unlikely. To be fair, they do run 4WR sets more than any other team, but Andy Isabella is still in line for some snaps as well. It's tough to see Moore as a reliable fantasy option without an injury ahead of him on the depth chart.                                                </div>

In an expanded role with Edelman out last year, Meyers totaled 45-plus yards in 9-of-11 games, including two games with 110-plus yards. He didn't score a single touchdown, which is part of the reason he's not getting any love. What if I told you he finished with just one fewer catch and 19 fewer yards than Brandon Aiyuk last year? The concern is the addition of Nelson Agholor and Kendrick Bourne, who both signed lucrative deals. Meyers is worth a late-round pick in case he is the top receiver in New England.                                                </div>

He set a career-high by hitting 92.6% of his field-goal attempts, including all four of his ones from 50 or more yards. The problem was largely the lack of volume, as he attempted just 27 field goals on the season after 38 the year before. Even with his "down" year, Butker remains one of the most accurate kickers in the game playing on an elite offense. He should be drafted as one of the first few kickers off the board, and managers should just hope the Kansas City offense stalls just a bit more before reaching the end zone.                                                </div>

Campbell had nine targets, six receptions, and 71 yards in the one game he played last year. Do you know how many times Michael Pittman (who's being drafted as a top-50 wide receiver) can say he hit those numbers? Once. Both former second rounders have a ceiling depending on who Carson Wentz favors, but it's not built into Campbell's price. If Wentz keeps doing what he did in Philadelphia, that's targeting tight ends/slot receivers over the middle of the field, which is primarily where Campbell lines up.                                                </div>

He'll again play in a dome in Atlanta, but with new head coach Arthur Smith and an offense that will be slower and less explosive without Julio Jones, it's far from a sure thing that he'll see 39 field-goal attempts again. Nevertheless, the indoor environment and Koo's success from long range makes him a top-five option at the kicker position.                                                </div>

He fell off a cliff after that, leading fantasy managers to search for new options in 2021, but there might be a reason to head back to the well. With the addition of A.J. Green, it's likely we see Kirk move to the slot, which is where I believe he should've been playing all along. Despite being inefficient and limited in athleticism at his advanced age, Larry Fitzgerald saw 112, 109, and 72 targets as the primary slot receiver over the last three years under Kliff Kingsbury. If Kirk can get near the 100-target mark, he'll be a value in drafts.                                                </div>

Judging by ADP on the entire Jets roster, many are still approaching the team as if they're run by Adam Gase. Insider info: They're not. Wilson is locked in as the starter all year long in Mike LaFleur's offense, and fantasy managers need to know about Wilson's upside as a rusher. Even Daniel Jones, who threw for 11 touchdowns in 14 games last year and missed two games, finished as a top-24 quarterback due to his 423 yards and one touchdown on the ground. Wilson is going to finish as a top-20 fantasy quarterback in year one.                                                </div>

The issue I have believing that is due to his strengths not aligning with Jared Goff's strengths. It's no secret that Goff has struggled to consistently throw the ball down the field, and it's part of the reason the Rams moved on from him. Perriman will be playing in another new offense with another new quarterback, something he knows all too well at this point. There will likely be a few splash weeks, but you should be happy to let someone else draft him.                                                </div>

He missed seven field-goal attempts and three extra-point attempts last year, but was a solid fantasy starter simply because of his volume. He led the league in field-goal attempts with 41, and was accurate within 50 yards, missing just a single kick. But he simply couldn't hit from long range, going just 3-for-9 from 50-plus yards. With Dak Prescott back, the Dallas offense should put up plenty of points, which should again provide Zuerlein with a ton of opportunities. If he can rediscover his accuracy from long distance, he'll likely be a stud option, but even if not, he's a fantasy starter.                                                </div>

The Colts offensive line might be better than the one the Eagles had in those days, though they'll need Eric Fisher healthy as soon as possible. Despite his bad 2020 season, Wentz has posted QB1-type numbers in 44.1 percent of the games in his career, which ranks as the 16th best quarterback over the last 15 years. *Update* Wentz has a foot issue that could require surgery, and the Colts are bracing for him to miss time at the start of the year.

The signing of Kerryon Johnson clouded his outlook though, making him just a late-round flier.                                                </div>

If they align him as the big slot, he can make more of an impact with Sam Darnold, who has always favored his targets over the middle of the field. If they put him on the perimeter, it'll be a lot tougher for him to produce immediately while behind D.J.

Should anything happen to Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Williams would step into a 15-touch role and be an every-week starter. He has very little until that happens, but that can be said about many handcuffs available. If you play in a league that has eight bench spots, Williams should have a spot at the end of it.                                                </div>

We've also heard Derek Carr say that Edwards reminded him of his former teammate in college, Davante Adams, which is never a bad thing.                                                </div>

He did lead all Giants wide receivers in targets (97) but it didn't lead to much in the production department, as he tallied just 50 receptions for 751 yards and three touchdowns. The Giants appeared to lose confidence in him, too, as they signed Kenny Golladay in free agency, and then drafted Kadarius Toney. Suddenly, Slayton may not be a starter on this offense, as Sterling Shepard and Golladay are the locked-in starters, while Toney figures to start in the slot. At this point, Slayton shouldn't even be drafted.                                                </div>

But now we're expecting Jared Goff to make that happen with St. Brown? There's a possibility, sure, but it's a slim one.                                                </div>

Knowing Rodgers specifically requested for the Packers to get Cobb back, it tells you he's getting opportunity right out of the gate, though it's worth noting he's never played in Matt LaFleur's offense. We shouldn't go overboard, though. The last three seasons Cobb was in Green Bay, he averaged 6.4 targets, 4.4 receptions, 44.5 yards, and 0.27 touchdowns per game, which extrapolate to 70 receptions, 712 yards, and four touchdowns over a full 16-game season. My guess would be that Cobb is a solid bye-week filler who'll offer a solid floor.                                                </div>

He was perfect from within 40 yards and on extra-point attempts, went 12-of-14 from 40-49 yards, and 8-of-9 from 50 yards or more. Sanders had never shown that level of accuracy from long range before, so fantasy managers would be wise to view it with a bit of skepticism. Still, with his 2020 performance, it would be difficult to consider drafting him as anything but a top-10 kicker in fantasy.                                                </div>

Giving him $8 million is not peanuts by any means and they have talked about how big of a role he'll have with the team, including Kyler Murray who said, "A lot of people are sleeping on him." The Bengals wide receivers all underperformed expectations last year, though Green was the ringleader, finishing with 63.8 fewer fantasy points than his opportunity suggested. We saw Hopkins make a difference in year one of the Cardinals system, so it's not like they discriminate against new bodies. Green is currently free in fantasy drafts, and knowing this team targeted wide receivers 65.5 percent of the time in 2020 (sixth in NFL), it makes sense to grab him with your final pick. If he gets six-plus targets in Week 1, he's going to be a popular waiver wire addition.                                                </div>

I'm expecting a bigger role on obvious passing downs, while carrying some solid handcuff value in a high-scoring offense.                                                </div>

Lazard had his shot at a breakout, but unfortunately, it didn't happen.                                                </div>

He wasn't good in 2020 - there's no denying that, though it certainly didn't help that his top receiver was out for most of the season, and they were weak behind him on the depth chart. The Patriots beefed up their wide receiver/tight end depth chart by signing quite a few players, including Jonnu Smith, Nelson Agholor, and Hunter Henry. Knowing that Newton still flashed 500-plus yard rushing upside, he can be considered a solid streamer as long as he has the job, but if he plays like he did last year, his starting job will be short lived.                                                </div>

Just a few years removed of being the Patriots first round pick, Michel finds himself fighting for touches in this backfield. It appears Damien Harris is the starter, while James White handles passing down work, and Rhamondre Stevenson and Michel fight for the scraps. Is it possible that Michel's injury last year has us overlooking his potential? He may have only had 79 carries last year, but he did average a massive 5.7 yards per carry on them. Maybe he's just better in a timeshare? This backfield is a mess, especially if Cam Newton is under center.                                                </div>

It's why Jonnu Smith was capped at 65 targets while Anthony Firkser saw 53 of his own. I'm not saying that'll be the split between these two, but Hurst is going to get more targets than some expect, limiting Kyle Pitts' true target ceiling.                                                </div>

Not just Gainwell, though, as the team also signed Kerryon Johnson once the Lions released him. Opportunity is fading for Scott, who's nowhere near the redraft radar at this point.                                                </div>

He attempted only 28 field goals and hardly made the most of them, converting only 21. That 75% field goal percentage was his worst since 2008, and his accuracy from long-range, usually his calling card, waned significantly, as he went just 10-for-17 from 40 yards or more (though he did set the NFL record for most career field goals of 50-yards or more). He signed a two-year deal with the Cardinals in the offseason and Arizona's fast-paced offense should allow for extra opportunities for Prater. He's not the kicker he once was, but he should see enough volume and have enough juice left in his leg to be a startable option.                                                </div>

Unfortunately, the Panthers offensive line continues to get worse, and it's tough to say Sam Darnold is an upgrade at quarterback, making Hubbard a mediocre handcuff in fantasy.                                                </div>

The fantasy points weren't there for him last year, as San Francisco often converted touchdowns rather than settling for field goals once they got into the red zone. In fact, Gould's 23 field-goal attempts were his lowest ever in a full season (Gould missed one game lat year, but still). But he converted at an 82.6% rate, and hit 11 of his 14 attempts from 40 yards or more. With natural regression, Gould should see his field-goal attempts jump by about 25%, and he should be a top-12 kicker by season's end if he can maintain his level of performance for another season.                                                </div>

The New Orleans offense was simply far less explosive with a declining (and injured) Drew Brees, and Lutz couldn't make up for his lack of efficiency with increased volume. Given Lutz's injury and the now less-desirable New Orleans offense, there's no reason to consider him in fantasy leagues.                                                </div>

He was perfect on his field-goal attempts, and converted the longest attempt in the NFL at 61 yards.

Even so, he still finished as th No. 10 quarterback in fantasy, and he should continue to be a reliable option. If Seattle can manage to attempt more field-goal attempts than the 26 they have averaged over the last two seasons, Myers could be an elite option.                                                </div>

He was likely brought in due to his experience in Anthony Lynn's offense, which gives him a leg up on the competition, as that's the play-caller he had his breakout 1,059-yard, seven-touchdown season under. Unfortunately, Jared Goff hasn't been a great deep passer in the NFL, which is where Williams has made most of his noise, averaging at least 15.3 yards per reception in each of his five NFL seasons played. Still, there should be at least some value in a wide receiver who's likely to lead the Lions wide receivers in targets.                                                </div>

Kelley acted as the early-down back for the Chargers last year, but wound up averaging more than 4.0 yards per carry just four times all season, including seven games averaging 3.1 or less yards per carry. Neither Justin Jackson nor Austin Ekeler had issues running behind the line, as both of them tallied 4.6 yards per carry. The Chargers also have a new coaching staff and drafted Larry Rountree in the 2021 draft, which could make Kelley expendable, or pushed down the depth chart.                                                </div>

If it's Hill, he's going to jump all the way up into the top-15 quarterback conversation. If I knew he'd start all 17 games, he'd be ranked top-10 for his rushing upside, but it seems like Jameis Winston has the slight edge heading into camp. Do you think that sounds crazy? It's not. Hill was the QB6 during the month he started while Drew Brees was out. This is a battle we'll be watching closely as the season nears.                                                </div>

This has led to us hearing about the Bills exploring a trade for Evan Engram, as well as Zach Ertz. They signed Jacob Hollister, who's expected to compete for the starting job, though with all the receiving options they have, it's not likely either provides much fantasy value. There were just three occasions where a Bills tight end saw more than four targets last year, which means you'll use them in streaming situations. It's tough envisioning any sort of breakout season from Knox.                                                </div>

The Jets brought in a new coaching staff, and with that, they brought in a multitude of pass catchers. First, it was Corey Davis, who's built nearly identical to Mims (both 6-foot-3, just two pounds apart). Next, it was Keelan Cole, who's been underutilized throughout his career. Lastly, they drafted Elijah Moore, who's a utility blade in the offense. Oh, and they still haven't released Jamison Crowder. He's going to have a tough time seeing the field on a consistent basis.                                                </div>

If Badgley wins the job, and recaptures his 2018-2019 form, then he should be a borderline starter in fantasy leagues this season.                                                </div>

But he also had 63 extra-point attempts, the most among kickers. In essence, Crosby was a victim of Aaron Rodgers' dominance once the Packers got near the end zone. There should be at least some natural regression to the mean this year (he had averaged 31 field-goal attempts in his 13 other seasons), and given that Crosby converted all of his field-goal tries, there's no reason to expect a decline. He's a borderline started in 12-team leagues, but ignore the low volume from last year.                                                </div>

It's easy to forget that Howard was supposed to be the next big thing at tight end, similar to how people feel about Kyle Pitts today. Early reports out of Bucs camp suggest Howard is being flexed as a receiver and that Brady sees him as a legit threat in the passing game. With Gronkowski getting up there in age/bumps/bruises, we could see Howard finally take the step many thought he would years ago. Best of all, you'll find out for free.                                                </div>

In other words, it's worth drafting Carlson in a standard-sized league, but he's far from a guarantee in terms of his success.                                                </div>

Next, it was an injury that kept him sidelined through rookie mini-camp. Lastly, it was being placed on the COVID reserve list. With all the setbacks, my guess is that the Giants open the season with Kenny Golladay, Sterling Shepard, and Darius Slayton in 3WR sets while Toney has to earn a place in the offense. There's no guarantee that happens early in the season, making Toney a very shaky pick in redraft formats.                                                </div>

But the Broncos were willing to trust him from long range, which included 15 field-goal attempts from at least 50 yards, of which he converted 10. Playing in Denver's thin air, McManus is always a threat to convert from long range, so he should be considered a borderline startable option in standard-sized leagues.                                                </div>

Do we really think this offense is going to produce two fantasy-relevant wide receivers? Somehow, Collins went from sleeper in the NFL Draft, to sleeper on a bad football team. You can like him in dynasty, that's fine, but in 2021, it's hard to see him reaching 80-plus targets if Brandin Cooks is healthy. Even outside of Cooks, the team decided to pay Andre Roberts $2.6 million, Conley $1.5 million, Chris Moore $1.3 million, and then traded for Anthony Miller. This just reeks of a situation to avoid in fantasy. Heck, even if Deshaun Watson were starting (which he's not), you'd have trouble projecting the target distribution for these receivers, though he would give Collins more of that "sleeper" appeal. I'm okay letting someone else take a shot on a non-Cooks receiver.                                                </div>

Unfortunately, he landed on a depth chart that's now crowded with Raheem Mostert, Trey Sermon, Jeff Wilson, and Elijah Mitchell. The injury to Wilson that'll keep him out at the start of the season likely holds a roster spot for Gallman, but he still likely needs another injury to be relevant.                                                </div>

I say that because Aaron Rodgers isn't someone who develops chemistry with his wide receivers immediately, and not just that, but the two haven't played together at all with Aaron missing all offseason programs. Amari has actually been raised around Cobb because his dad was Cobb's receivers coach at the University of Kentucky, so there should be good tutelage during Amari's rookie season, but it's tough to see him getting meaningful touches in the offense right away, and even if he does get on the field, he has to earn Aaron's trust. If you go back through Aaron's time with the Packers, you'll see that practically every receiver took time to turn into a fantasy option, including Davante Adams.                                                </div>

The issue for Boswell from a fantasy perspective, however, is that playing his home games on Heinz Field's difficult turf, as well as just his natural skill set, generally limits his attempts from 50 yards or beyond. Indeed, he's attempted just four field goals from that range in the last three seasons. Boswell is your classic high-floor, low-ceiling play, who is better utilized as a weekly streamer when you're favored to win.                                                </div>

He doesn't have the biggest leg and hits at only about a 50% clip from 50 yards or beyond. The Washington offense should be better this year with Ryan Fitzpatrick under center, so Hopkins could see more than the 34 attempts he did last year. But, ultimately, he's in that large conglomerate of streamable kickers, but one who doesn't separate himself from the pack.                                                </div>

Landing with Arthur Smith on the Falcons depth chart may have been his best shot at relevance, as the Falcons have almost no depth behind Mike Davis. I wouldn't expect more than 5-8 touches without injury, but he's a name worth monitoring if Davis were to miss time.                                                </div>

Hilton, Michael Pittman, and Parris Campbell. He's made the most of his opportunity, totaling at least 600 yards and five touchdowns in each of the last two seasons despite not eclipsing 72 targets. However, going into 2021 with a healthy group of pass catchers, Pascal will only be on the field in 4WR sets, which doesn't work for fantasy.                                                </div>

From Week 4 through Week 8, Fulgham scored 82.0 half PPR points while no other receiver scored more than 74.3 of them. Then, suddenly, the Eagles chose to not involve him in the offense anymore. It was odd, really. The Eagles now clearly have Devonta Smith and Jalen Reagor ahead of him on the depth chart, but if Jalen Hurts can take a step forward in his passing in 2021, we could see Fulgham have a few usable weeks in fantasy as the team's No. 3 receiver.                                                </div>

That's rare for me to say, as I'm a value-based fantasy manager, but I just don't see value on this team. Watson has stood by the fact that he doesn't want to play for the Texans and isn't participating in camp. On top of that, he might be facing a suspension by the NFL for his pending assault cases. We talk about how easy replacing a quarterback is in fantasy every year, so why would we risk a draft pick on Watson? Unless it's one of your final picks, I would just avoid the situation. Taylor has given us fantasy-viable performances in the past, but the last time that happened was in 2017, when he had much more mobility than he does today. Despite starting at least 14 games in three straight seasons with the Bills, Taylor never threw for more than 3,035 yards in a season. He's now 33 years old and playing for 65-year-old David Culley with one of the worst supporting casts in the league. He also has the Texans third-round pick Mills waiting in the wings. This is one of those situations where I'm okay being wrong if one of these quarterbacks pans out.                                                </div>

You need the targets for Akins to be considered an option, because on top of Tyrod Taylor's struggles, Akins himself has scored just three touchdowns on 129 career targets, which is well below the league average for tight ends. There were four games last year where Akins saw six-plus targets in Tim Kelly's offense, but that didn't amount to much, as he never topped 10.9 half-PPR points in a game, and that was with Deshaun Watson under center.                                                </div>

He now finds himself in about as bad a situation as he could, playing for a poor Texans team with a crowded running back room, which includes David Johnson, Mark Ingram, and Phillip Lindsay. If one or more of those backs get cut, then Burkhead could have some value by default, but until or unless that happens, he can be ignored in fantasy circles.                                                </div>

He's only received 48 targets over his first two years in the league, though they've netted 413 yards and three touchdowns, so it's not like he wasn't productive with them. The issue is that we now have DeAndre Hopkins, A.J. Green, and then a trio of second-round picks fighting behind them. Moore, who was drafted at 49 overall this year, Kirk who was drafted at 47 overall three years ago, and Isabella, who was drafted at 62 overall. If they didn't give Isabella the nod over Fitzgerald last year, I can't see it happening, especially when they chose to draft another second-round receiver.                                                </div>

That time has passed, as he's now entering his third season with just 32 receptions under his belt. He's actually performed solid on a per-target basis, but his opportunity is gone with the additions of Rashod Bateman, Sammy Watkins, and Tylan Wallace to the wide receiver depth chart. He wasn't fantasy relevant without them, so he sure as heck won't be with them.                                                </div>

He was drafted by the Raiders in the third round only to get shipped to Miami before the season began. Although the Dolphins were in need of playmakers, Bowden did little in his 10 games, with just nine carries and 28 receptions. He's a versatile player and can make things happen when the ball in his hands, but with the Dolphins adding Will Fuller and drafting Jaylen Waddle, and Myles Gaskin and Salvon Ahmed in the backfield, there's almost no chance for Bowden to have fantasy value this year absent multiple injuries ahead of him.                                                </div>
