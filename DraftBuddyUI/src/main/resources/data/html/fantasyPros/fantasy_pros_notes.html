Outside of saying, "running backs don't repeat as the top option," there's nothing that should suggest McCaffrey won't. He's not just a running back. He's a wide receiver. He scored 182.5 half-PPR points through the air alone, which would've been the No. 20 wide receiver in fantasy last year, ahead of Stefon Diggs. Even if McCaffrey simply stopped playing football in Week 12, he would've finished as the No. 1 running back by a massive 22.1 PPR points. The new offense and improved quarterback play shouldn't hurt at all.                                                </div>

Playing through injury was a clear net-negative to his overall numbers, and something he hopefully learned from. The biggest difference was breakaway runs of 15-plus yards, as Barkley rattled off 20 of them in his rookie season, but just nine of them in his sophomore season. With all the weapons in this offense, you have to wonder just how many targets Barkley will get, but trust me, the Giants are building their offense around him and not anyone else. If Daniel Jones can take a step forward in year two, it'll help open lanes for Barkley.

Cook took his game to another level in 2019, finishing as the No. 5 running back despite missing two games. Not only did he total 18-plus carries in eight games, but he also ranked third in yards per route run among running backs. With Stefon Diggs gone, we could see him highlighted even more in the passing game, though Justin Jefferson will eat some of them. Cook also led the league with 21 carries inside the five-yard-line. Health has always been a question mark with Cook, but when healthy, he's easily a top-10 back.                                                </div>

Oddly enough, he's never finished as No. 1 though. The Cowboys passing offense just got better with the addition of CeeDee Lamb, and while that may put a cap on Elliott's targets in the passing game, he should be free to rock against seven-man fronts. He saw eight-plus defenders in the box 19.3 percent of the time last year, a number that may dip down into the single digits, provided the Cowboys go three-wide more often than not. Stop trying to find "the next big thing," because Elliott has proven time and time again that he's among the safest picks at the top of the draft. He's posted RB2 or better numbers in 92.9 percent of his career games, which is better than any running back I've ever charted. In fact, the closest is Le'Veon Bell, who's hit that mark 87.0 percent of the time.                                                </div>

Kamara has now topped 25 PPR points in 14 of his 45 career games, which is quite ridiculous. His 2019 season was easily his worst to date, though he still finished as the RB12 despite missing two games. The Saints offense continues to groove, and though Drew Brees is still playing great football, his arm strength is declining, which could lead to more targets than every for Kamara, who's averaged 6.7 targets per game over the first three years in a Saints uniform. Provided he doesn't get hurt, Kamara is a near-lock to finish as a top-six running back.                                                </div>

He saw 185 targets on a team that threw the ball just 581 times. That's a ridiculous 31.8 percent target share. Just so you know, it's rare for a receiver to see a 25 percent target share. I've already stated in the Drew Brees paragraph that I expect this offense to throw just a bit less in 2020. Initial projections have them around 560 pass attempts, so bringing that down to even a 28 percent target share would force Thomas to lose about 28 targets. You can see why a repeat of last year's numbers are unlikely, especially when you factor in the arrival of Emmanuel Sanders as a rock-solid No. 2 receiver who'll garner more targets than Ted Ginn and/or Tre'Quan Smith would've. Still, Thomas is my WR1 heading into the season, because outside of injury, he's projected as my top receiver by a full 15 half-PPR points.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Fade aging wide receivers, they said. Julio laughs as he posted his sixth straight season with more than 1,390 yards. He still has just one season under his belt with double-digit touchdowns, which is quite ridiculous when you consider he's had three seasons with 1,500-plus yards. He's as safe as they come at the wide receiver position. Think 31 years old is too old? Check out this piece on what age a wide receiver declines. There are a lot of fantasy owners drafting Tyreek Hill over him, and while I understand the upside Hill presents on a weekly basis, Jones presents stability that Hill can only dream of. Hill has posted WR2 or better numbers in 21-of-43 games (48.8 percent) over his career. Meanwhile, Jones has hit that mark in 64.8 percent of his career games and has posted WR1-type numbers in 42.4 percent of them. Sure, Calvin Ridley is going to ascend, but a lot of his ascension comes from the missing targets from Mohamed Sanu. Jones should be the No. 3 wide receiver off draft boards, at worst.                                                </div>

Yes, he was dominant in the playoffs. We still can't forget that he was the No. 14 running back in points per game before Week 10 last year, behind David Johnson and Mark Ingram. Should we automatically assume Henry picks up where he left off in 2019? My issue with Henry is that he's not involved in the passing-game, which lowers his weekly floor. That alone will allow us to choose someone like Alvin Kamara over him. Henry is best-suited as a second-round pick rather than one in the first round.                                                </div>

In my Boom, Bust, and Everything In Between series, I highlighted the fact that he's been a WR2 or better in just 44.1 percent of his career games, while someone like Julio Jones has posted WR1 numbers in 42.4 percent of his games. Hill averaged just 7.4 targets per game last year, a number that will need to come up for him to be a more consistent fantasy option. Can it happen? Absolutely. The addition of Clyde Edwards-Helaire will not help that, nor will the supposed increase in Mecole Hardman offensive snaps. There were just two games in 2019 where Hill saw double-digit targets, which again, limits his consistency. By comparison, Davante Adams has averaged 11.0 targets per game over the last two years while Julio Jones saw 10-plus targets in 7-of-15 games in 2019. If you want to draft Hill as your WR1, I have no issue with it, but understand that you'll need to balance your roster throughout the remainder of the draft. Robert Woods is someone that immediately comes to mind as consistent and reliable, and would make a perfect complement to someone like Hill.                                                </div>

He's a true three-down back who can catch 80-plus passes out of the backfield, while running for 1,000-plus yards. Landing with the Chiefs was a dream scenario, especially in the first round. Over the last seven years, running backs who've been drafted in the first round have averaged 280.7 touches in year one. 75 percent of them have finished as an RB2 or better. Don't think this is Darwin Thompson all over again, as he was a sixth-round pick last year, and those average just 29.8 touches in year one. This is Edwards-Helaire's backfield after Andy Reid said he's better than Brian Westbrook on film. You don't take those players off the field very often. He's worth a second-round pick and would be a steal in the third round.                                                </div>

They waited until the fourth round to select UCLA's Joshua Kelley, who's a bigger complementary back. The Chargers offense isn't likely going to be as high scoring as it was with Philip Rivers under center, but Ekeler remains the top dog in the backfield. Still, don't just anticipate this offense is going to be as potent, or that he'll have as many scoring opportunities, which is why he's best-suited as a high-end RB2 than an RB1.                                                </div>

Now going to a Cardinals team with Christian Kirk and Larry Fitzgerald, it's unlikely he reaches that mark. The odd offseason also hasn't given him a lot of time with new quarterback Kyler Murray. From reports, the first time the duo got together was at the end of June. Is that enough time to develop any sort of chemistry? Hopkins has played with a lot of bad quarterbacks in his time, though the only one who held him back from producing was Brock Osweiler, as Hopkins finished as the No. 29 wide receiver in 2016 despite seeing 151 targets. Murray's rookie season wasn't particularly efficient (both Fitzgerald and Kirk saw over 105 targets but outside the top-36 wide receivers), but we should expect growth in year two. There is a scenario where Hopkins is a rock-solid player but not a top-five fantasy receiver, however, given his history of producing with guys like Tom Savage, TJ Yates, and Brian Hoyer, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. Still, his targets will take a hit, making him a second-round pick rather than the first-round one he's been.                                                </div>

That's a very good thing. I want to do an exercise with you. Close your eyes and imagine Tom Brady dropping back to pass. What do you see? Do you see him muscling a pass towards the sideline? I didn't think so. I also saw him targeting a receiver over the middle of the field. Godwin played 63.4 percent of his snaps last year in the slot. He was second in the league in slot yards (838) behind only Cooper Kupp, and despite seeing 31 fewer slot targets than Kupp, he only finished with 15 fewer yards and the same number of touchdowns. Godwin's average depth of target was 10.4 yards last year while Mike Evans' was 15.3 yards. The average depth of target for Brady last year was 7.6 yards down the field. It's clear that Godwin should quickly become a favorite of Brady, who hates to take risks, as Godwin is a better separator than Evans. Believe it or not, there's a clear path for Godwin to finish as the WR1 in 2020. I don't say that about many receivers. He's in the tier immediately after Michael Thomas, Davante Adams, and Julio Jones.                                                </div>

It's another thing to project a breakout due to an increase in offensive production. Mixon got the opportunity last year under Zac Taylor, as he totaled 18-plus touches on 10 different occasions. But he'll need the offense to take a step forward in 2020 if he wants to ascend into stardom, as he's been an RB2 or better in just 57 percent of his games over the last two years. You must pay attention to his contract status as you approach drafts because Mixon has stated he'll hold out without an extension. This is a real thing with running backs, as they're trying to preserve their health while cashing in on a second contract. Stay tuned.                                                </div>

If you have "your guys" in the middle rounds, Kelce makes sense as an early-round pick. He's now posted TE1-type numbers in 28-of-32 games over the last two years. It also helps when you see 41.4 percent of your team's targets inside the 10-yard line, like Kelce did in 2019.                                                </div>

The 49ers added Brandon Aiyuk who'll help stretch the field, which should in turn just open things a bit more for Kittle. His arrow continues to point up. The touchdowns may not match those of Travis Kelce, but we know not to rely on consistency in that department.                                                </div>

Based on where his targets took place, he had the fourth-most expected fantasy points among wide receivers last year. There's little reason to expect that to change, as the Bears lost Taylor Gabriel and replaced him with an older, slower version in Ted Ginn. There were just two games last season where Robinson finished with fewer than seven targets, making him an easy every-week start. In fact, he posted WR2 or better numbers in 62.5 percent of his games, which ranked fifth behind only Michael Thomas, DeAndre Hopkins, Julio Jones, and Davante Adams. The fact that the Bears snagged Nick Foles only helps the Bears receivers, as they have twice the chance at competent quarterback play. Robinson should be considered a high-floor, low-end WR1, as it's unlikely he comes with the ceiling of those with better quarterback play.                                                </div>

Is that worrisome to Jones' production? Maybe a bit, as Matt LaFleur seems to want to continue his timeshare ways. Jones is by far the most talented, so even if we were to see him dip down to 13-15 touches per game, that's enough for him to do damage, especially considering Rodgers targets him in the passing game. Jones is one of just two running backs (Alvin Kamara is the other) who've finished with a top-30 season over the last 10 years with less than 300 touches. Jones is one of the most efficient running backs in football, though the coaching staff keeps him in RB2 territory.                                                </div>

Then we heard, "we're going to involve him more in 2020." They then re-signed Jalen Richard, added Henry Ruggs, and Lynn Bowden. It's not looking likely that Jacobs sees the 50-plus targets he deserves, which lowers him down the rankings. The overall offense should improve, giving him more scoring opportunities, but relying on touchdowns is a tricky thing. He's best-suited as a high-end RB2 who has RB1 upside if they follow through on the promise to use him more in the passing game.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">If you invested a first-round pick in Mahomes last year, you weren't happy with the results. In games he started, he posted QB1-type numbers in just 57.1 percent of them. However, there were some factors to take into consideration. One, he was going to regress. Two, he suffered an injury during the Week 7 game against the Broncos that seemed to affect him throughout the remainder of the regular season. In the seven games following that injury, he threw for three touchdowns just once, while throwing for more than 283 yards just twice. Was that a sign of things to come? Probably not considering he threw for 901 yards and 10 touchdowns in three playoff games. You must ask yourself, "What's the worst/best-case scenario with Mahomes?" prior to drafting him. Worst case was probably last year, where he was the No. 52 value-based player. That means if we'd drafted 2019 all over again, his value would've been correct as the 52nd player selected, so a fifth-round pick. Best case scenario is that he finishes as the No. 5 value-based player like he did in 2018. If you're somewhere in the middle, he's still worth a third-round pick with upside for more. Most of the time with Mahomes, it all just depends on your particular draft, as there are some who'll see him go in the first round of their 1QB league. You're baking in too much risk there. As a late-second, early-third round pick, you have some room for growth. Anything beyond that is just a steal. With the lack of offseason, it'll affect defenses more than it will offenses, so we could see a record-breaking year for Mahomes.                                                </div>

He's an extremely good football player who's been stuck in a bad situation. He made the most of bad targets last year, finishing as the WR18 and delivering WR2 or better performances 60.0 percent of the time, which ranked eighth among wide receivers. Now another obstacle to cross. He'll have a new quarterback and a new head coach in 2020. The coach (Matt Rhule) also decided they needed to bring in Robby Anderson, a receiver who previously played under him, which could mean the targets get spread out a bit. The good news is that Bridgewater attempted a deep ball on just 7.1 percent of his pass attempts, which was the second-lowest rate in the NFL, and not an area where Moore operates. The talent is there for Moore to make a jump into WR1 status, but the situation doesn't seem ideal with virtually no offseason. He's best suited as a WR2 on fantasy teams, as top-24 should be his absolute floor.                                                </div>

He played through multiple injuries and dealt with what was probably the worst quarterback situation in the league. In Week 1 and Week 2, when Ben Roethlisberger was on the field, Smith-Schuster saw 16 targets, catching 11 of them for 162 yards. Not too shabby. Insert bad quarterbacks, paired with Smith-Schuster trying to run routes from the perimeter, and it was a recipe for disaster. The Steelers have vowed to put him back in the slot where he belongs, and he's getting back Roethlisberger, who's continually supported fantasy receivers throughout his long career. Going all the way back to 2008, Ben Roethlisberger's No. 1 and No. 2 wide receivers combined for at least 225 targets on eight different occasions, including 334 times when he had Antonio Brown and Smith-Schuster in 2018. With Roethlisberger on the field, the Steelers haven't thrown the ball less than 584 times since way back in 2012. It's hard to see a scenario where Smith-Schuster doesn't see at least 130 targets if he's healthy (that would be just a 22.2 percent target share), which is elite volume, so even if he's average, he'd be a high-end WR2. I'll leave you with this... Smith-Schuster posted 1,426 yards in his second NFL season at the age of 22. There are just six players who posted more yardage in one of their first two seasons. The list includes Isaac Bruce, Josh Gordon, Torry Holt, Jerry Rice, Victor Cruz, and Odell Beckham Jr. We can't pretend Smith-Schuster is anywhere close to average. He's worth a third-round pick in drafts, even though many are getting him in the fourth.                                                </div>

Well, I hate to break it to you, but he was not a WR1 in terms that actually matter to you, the fantasy player. Despite averaging an elite 9.1 targets per game, Evans posted WR2 or better-type numbers in just 38.5 percent of his games. That ranked 28th among wide receivers. Seriously, guys like Sterling Shepard, Cole Beasley, and Jamison Crowder had higher percentages. Now you take away Jameis Winston, someone who was more than willing to throw the ball into tight coverage all the time, and swap him with one of the most risk averse quarterbacks in football? Evans' 2.4 yards of separation at target was one of the worst marks among wide receivers, and while it doesn't tell the full story, those who watch Evans knows he uses his body extremely well to box out defenders rather than gain multiple yards of separation with precision route running. Look, he's still a good player who's totaled at least 1,000 yards in each of his first six NFL seasons, so I'm not completely writing him off, though it does help that he's seen at least 8.7 targets per game over the last five years. I don't think Brady is as bad as some think at throwing the deep ball anymore, I just don't think he does it nearly as often as Winston did/was willing to. I'm expecting a slight dip in targets and less air yards, which in turn, equals less production for a player like Evans. It's not bad if you land him as your WR2, but I wouldn't recommend him as a WR1.                                                </div>

That's not a recipe for success for a wide receiver, though it helps that he's the only steady presence at wide receiver. Most will look at the target totals from last year and wonder where his targets come from, but don't forget that Thielen saw 298 targets over the previous two seasons. Last year was an incredibly efficient year for the Vikings on the ground, and when you combine the fact that Thielen missed half the season, you can understand why their pass attempts came crashing down to earth. With the defense likely taking a step back after losing many starters, we should expect to see their run-to-pass ratio come back towards the league average, which would help Thielen's target potential. Knowing that he's the only receiver in the starting lineup who has any chemistry with Cousins, we should expect at least eight targets per game. That calls for him being a high-end WR2 at the very least when he's in the lineup, though his injury concerns have to be built into his cost. His current ADP is the WR11, which is too expensive for the risk you're taking on.                                                </div>

We talk all the time about regression when it comes to quarterbacks with a high touchdown rate, and Jackson is no different after posting a ridiculous 9.0 percent touchdown rate in 2019. That's going to come down. Lowering that mark to 5.0 percent (which is still above average), he would've thrown 20 touchdowns instead of the 36 that he did. However, something to help offset that is his rushing touchdown output. Based on where his carries took place last year, Jackson should've scored closer to 12 rushing touchdowns rather than the seven that he did. The downside to Jackson is that he's a bit thinner than you'd like as a mobile quarterback. While it's tough to get a clean hit on him, we have a history of mobile quarterbacks not withstanding a lot of hits. When you invest a second- or third-round pick on a quarterback, you need him on the field. If Jackson were a lock to play all 16 games, he'd be my QB1 and well worth a second-round pick. When you add in some of that risk, he's more of a third-round selection. There were nine separate occasions last year where he delivered 28-plus fantasy points. Those are week-winning performances.                                                </div>

If we were replaying last season, we wouldn't be drafting him until the fifth or sixth round of fantasy drafts. But that's where fantasy players go wrong. That's a one-year sample size. We had 59 career games prior to that we can look at where he was the best game-by-game fantasy wide receiver of all-time. Which do you trust? Everyone on the Browns struggled last year and knowing that Beckham was playing through a hernia only added to the disappointment. 2019 was the first year he'd posted WR2 or better numbers in less than 66.7 percent of his games (which is ridiculous). We know the offense is changing, but that also comes with some concerns. While in Minnesota last year, Kevin Stefanski's wide receivers combined for just 201 targets and a 43.1 percent target share, which ranked as the fourth-lowest mark in football. Stefon Diggs, who is also very talented, saw just 94 targets in 15 games last year. While I don't expect the Browns to be as run-heavy as the Vikings were, it's an added level of concern. But here's the thing - it's not like a lot of the wide receivers in the 10-15 range don't come with similar issues or question marks. Beckham has done it before and has true No. 1 overall wide receiver upside. He's in the prime of his career at 27 years old and his only competition for targets (Jarvis Landry) is coming off hip surgery. Getting him as your high-end WR2 is worth it.                                                </div>

Did you know Michael Gallup averaged more targets per game than Cooper last year? Cooper's injury may have played into that but it didn't stop him from being one of the best in the league. Based on the number of his targets and where they took place on the field, Cooper should've finished as the No. 23 wide receiver, and not the No. 9 receiver he did. In fact, he was the only receiver in the league who scored 20-plus more fantasy points than he was expected to in both the red zone and outside the red zone. The addition of CeeDee Lamb isn't going to make getting targets any easier for Cooper, who's now seen 195 targets in 25 games with the Cowboys. Because he's not getting the gaudy numbers that some are, Cooper should be considered a semi-volatile WR2 in fantasy who has more WR1 upside than most on a weekly basis. If Cooper were to get 150 targets, I have zero doubts that he'd finish as a top-three receiver, but as we've seen, that just doesn't happen.                                                </div>

Just one other team (Eagles) had their tight ends see over a 30.0 percent target share. Hayden Hurst is gone, which shifts those targets to the duo of Andrews and Boyle. While I anticipate some of them moving to the wide receivers, it's not a bad thing for Andrews supporters. I think many have forgotten just how hard it is for young tight ends to produce elite numbers, yet Andrews posted 852 yards and 10 touchdowns in his sophomore season on a team that threw the ball just 440 times. He's very good. With a slight bump in pass attempts for the team overall combined with the exit of Hurst, and we could see Andrews reach 120 targets this season. My issue with Andrews is that he's been a bit more inconsistent than the likes of Travis Kelce and George Kittle, so it takes a bit of projecting to see him reach that tier. Andrews played just 46 snaps per game in 2019, while those two averaged 60 snaps. For me, Andrews is in the tier directly behind them alongside Zach Ertz. If you can get him in the late-fourth or early-fifth round, I'm good with that. If you take him earlier, you're have to project 120 targets.                                                </div>

He then fell off hard, finishing as the No. 31 receiver over the final eight games, totaling just 36 receptions for 369 yards and five touchdowns. The Rams started moving towards more 12 personnel, which includes two tight ends, which in turn leaves just two wide receivers on the field. Knowing Kupp is a slot receiver by nature, it affects him greatly. He actually played just 61 percent of the team's snaps in Weeks 16 and 17. But I'd argue that Jared Goff needs him on the field. While targeting Kupp, Goff posted a 117.0 QB Rating. While targeting everyone else, that number is just 78.6. Sean McVay is consistently evolving as a play caller, which bodes well for Kupp, as he'll likely be expanded to different roles moving forward. There are question marks, that much we know. However, we have still yet to see a "bad" season from Kupp in the NFL. I don't consider him as safe as his teammate Robert Woods, but Kupp should still be considered a low-end WR2 who has more touchdown upside. I mean, he's scored 21 receiving touchdowns in 39 career games. Woods has 25 receiving touchdowns in 100 career games.                                                </div>

Now going into his third NFL season, there's a real chance for a breakout. Sure, Julio Jones isn't going away but he doesn't have to. Not many realize that Mohamed Sanu saw 94 targets in 2018 and was on pace for 96 targets before being traded in 2019. We don't really expect Russell Gage to fill that role, do we? If you want to know if there's room for both Ridley and Jones to be WR1s, look no further than the Bucs last year with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, even if it is rare for that to happen. Ridley saw 49 targets in the six games he played without Sanu, which would amount to 131 over an entire 16-game season. Ridley has real top-five breakout potential and is an ideal high-end WR2 on your fantasy team.                                                </div>

Now going to the Falcons, who have one of the better offensive lines in football, with little competition, Gurley could return to RB1 status. It's a high-scoring offense where the running backs have averaged 1,383 yards and 9.7 touchdowns on the ground, while averaging another 572 yards and 4.7 touchdowns through the air over the last three years. With Ito Smith and Brian Hill the only running backs behind him, Gurley should receive most of the work/production.                                                </div>

The only running backs who offered RB2 or better numbers more often than Fournette in 2019 were Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott, Dalvin Cook, and Austin Ekeler. Do they go with more of a timeshare under Gruden? it's possible, but he should still offer low-end RB1 value.                                                </div>

Not only that, but the Eagles added tons of wide receiver talent in this year's draft, which will only make targets harder to come by. Ertz should still be considered a top-five tight end by everyone, but he's not someone to consider in the top four rounds.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">WPrior to the NFL Draft last year, I had D.K. Metcalf as my 1A receiver and Brown as my 1B. Loved them both, but Metcalf's landing spot moved him into the driver's seat. Maybe I underestimated just how much Brown could do without an elite quarterback. Despite not being a full-time player until Week 9 and seeing just 84 targets, Brown finished as the No. 21 wide receiver in his rookie season. There have been just 10 wide receivers over the last 10 years who've finished as a top-24 fantasy receiver while seeing fewer than 87 targets. Going back to when Ryan Tannehill started playing, Brown received a very stable 21 percent target share. That's not elite. Not bad, but not elite. Let's go from Week 9 through Week 17 when Brown moved to a full-time role. Brown's target share was 24 percent in that time, which ranked 10th among wide receivers. If we project Tannehill for 480-500 pass attempts, that'd amount to 115-120 targets. It is possible Brown's target share goes up but staying at 24 percent feels like it's repeatable. It's important to note that Brown averaged a ridiculous 8.9 yards after the catch last year, a number that isn't repeatable. You typically won't see even the best of the best receivers average more than 6.0 yards after the catch. If you move Brown down to the 5.5 range, he would've recorded 187 fewer yards and finished as the WR28. Then you must factor in Tannehill's ridiculous 7.7 percent touchdown rate regressing, so don't automatically assume that Brown's efficiency remains the same. He's still a phenomenal talent, but he needs to get the bump in pass attempts to take the next step. If I were guaranteed 500 pass attempts out of Tannehill, I'd draft him as a low-end WR1. It's best to be a bit cautious though and have some equity built in, making him a WR2 with serious upside.                                                </div>

That's odd for me to say, as Bell was someone I was avoiding like the plague in drafts. The difference? Expectations. Playing him as your first-round pick in your RB1 slot was never something anyone should've expected, especially behind that offensive line and in Gase's offense. While he's still stuck in Gase's offense, the offensive line was upgraded quite a bit this offseason, which should allow Bell more room to work. Even if he repeated his 2019 performance, that's RB2 production. There were just 11 running backs who produced RB2 or better numbers more often than him. Sure, he didn't have a ton of weekly upside, but he was safe. Now coming off the board outside the top three rounds, Bell is a value play.                                                </div>

For example, he had six games of 15-plus fantasy points, but he also had eight games with less than nine fantasy points. Is it reasonable for him to grow as a player? Yes. Is there now a bit more competition for targets on the roster? Yes. With the shortened offseason, it will be difficult to learn a new playbook, especially for rookies like second-round pick Laviska Shenault. Because of that, Gardner Minshew will likely be looking Chark's way a lot. With a schedule that starts with the Colts, Titans, Dolphins, Bengals, Texans, and Lions, Chark should have a monster first half of the fantasy season. There are much tougher matchups as the season goes on, however, but drafting Chark as a low-end WR2 with upside in the fifth round makes sense. But again, you may want to look at the possibility of trading him during his bye in Week 7.                                                </div>

Clearly, he was affected by a serious shin contusion that had him in the hospital. I won't pretend that D.K. Metcalf started removing some of his elite target upside, but even Lockett's efficiency went down the tube. Combining Lockett's games under Brian Schottenheimer prior to the shin injury, he's totaled 116 receptions for 1,732 yards and 16 touchdowns over a span of 25 games. That's pretty dang good. Knowing that I'm projecting a rise in pass attempts for the Seahawks overall, Lockett should see 110-plus targets as long as he's healthy, a number that goes very far with Russell Wilson as his quarterback. Seriously, stop talking about regression when it comes to Wilson's receivers. First it was Doug Baldwin. Regression never really happened. Then there was Lockett. Next, it'll be Metcalf. Lockett is perfectly fine as your WR2. He's the safer of the Seahawks receivers because his role is locked in. If the Seahawks were to sign or bring in someone like Josh Gordon/Antonio Brown, that would affect Metcalf a lot more.                                                </div>

That's despite Philip Rivers throwing at least 28 touchdowns in five of them. He's a phenomenal route runner, but not the go-up-and-get-it receiver you'll fall in love with in the red zone. The move to Tyrod Taylor is likely going to be a tough one for Allen, as Taylor will lack pass attempts in comparison to Rivers. Even if we were to say the Chargers threw the ball 500 times (Taylor's career-high is 437 attempts), that's still a massive decrease from the 597 times they threw the ball in 2019. Taking away 97-plus targets will be felt throughout the depth chart, especially when you don't score a lot of touchdowns. It does help that the Chargers receiving corps is very top heavy with Allen and Mike Williams, though. Still, it's likely there'll be less than 250 targets between the Chargers receivers, so Allen isn't getting close to the 149 targets he got in 2019. Realistically, he's likely to be in the 110-120 target range. That's still enough for low-end WR2/high-end WR3 numbers, but don't expect the same Allen whose been relied upon as a borderline WR1 anymore.                                                </div>

Instead, he joins a now-exciting Broncos offense that suddenly has tons of firepower. You don't add Gordon in free agency if you don't plan on using him as your lead back. The potential upside is that new offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur has been a one-back kind of guy, so it's possible that Phillip Lindsay is just there to give Gordon breathers when he needs them. With Courtland Sutton, Jerry Jeudy, KJ Hamler, and Noah Fant out there are receiving threats, Gordon should see a lot of light fronts this year. He's a middling RB2 with RB1 upside if they decide to give him 15-plus touches per game.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">It was remarkable what McLaurin was able to do last year while playing on one of the worst teams in football. The disappointing part was that even though he saw 37.1 percent of his team's air yards (sixth in the NFL), he finished with just 93 targets. Knowing it's unlikely we see a big increase in pass attempts, it's hard for him to see an air yards number that is much higher. The reason we can be semi-optimistic with his targets is due to the lack of options around him. Kelvin Harmon and Paul Richardson are gone, along with the 86 targets they saw last year. In comes rookie Antonio Gandy-Golden, and veteran Dontrelle Inman, who was recently signed off the street. If we look at offensive coordinator Scott Turner's offense last year, you'll see it was very top-heavy when it came to the wide receivers, as D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel both hit 106-plus targets. I can't say there's anyone else on this Washington receiver depth chart that deserves more than 75 targets. This could be very similar to A.J. Brown, where we're looking at a player who might get a 25 percent target share in his offense, even if it is a low volume one. The difference is that McLaurin's quarterback hasn't ever posted all-time great numbers, and it's unreasonable to expect that. Still, McLaurin can likely live up to low-end WR2 expectations, though getting him as your WR3 is the ideal scenario.                                                </div>

That's a lot of work. The only running back they've added was David Johnson. While Johnson looked horrendous down the stretch, it's possible he just tried to work his way back from injury way too soon. It appears Bill O'Brien isn't convinced that Johnson is done with his NFL career, like some. It's possible that he's not as electric as he once was, but guys, the Texans gave Carlos Hyde (who's still unemployed) 255 touches last year. Opportunity is key in fantasy football, and Johnson appears to be in line for a lot of it in 2020, making him a low-end RB2 with upside for more should he actually be healthy.                                                </div>

He didn't finish as high as some thought (WR19), but it was a miracle he finished there if you were to go back and watch some of the passes he came down with. His 125 targets were the 15th most among wide receivers, though it's hard to see that continuing. He had zero competition for targets last year, which is why he saw over 50 percent of the ones that went to wide receivers. He'll now have to contend with first-round pick Jerry Jeudy, who's the most polished receiver who's come out in the last five years, and second-round pick KJ Hamler in the starting lineup. That's not to mention Melvin Gordon, who's an established pass-catcher out of the backfield. Sutton is clearly a star, but this offense is now littered with talented pass catchers. There were just two games all last year Sutton saw fewer than seven targets, but I think that number goes up this year. He was a middling WR2 last year with those high target totals, yet he's being drafted essentially where he finished last year, and that's despite the improved talent around him. If Sutton wants to finish better than a low-end WR2/high-end WR3, he's going to need double-digit touchdowns, and that's just not something I can predict given the talent around him.                                                </div>

Or how about he had no agility because his three-cone drill was bad? Or how about that J.J. Arcega-Whiteside, Mecole Hardman, Parris Campbell, and Andy Isabella went before him? Yeah, me too. Despite having a knee scope done during the last preseason, Metcalf managed to make it back for Week 1 where he racked up 89 yards on six targets. He wound up tallying nine games with more than 60 yards, which ranked 10th among wide receivers. That doesn't even count his playoff game against the Eagles where he broke the rookie record for receiving yards (160) in a playoff game. There was progression in his routes as the year went on, and he's been working out with Russell Wilson at his house this offseason. At 6-foot-4 and 229 pounds, the ceiling is endless with Metcalf, who has true WR1 potential as soon as this year. The biggest concern is that the Seahawks were looking into Antonio Brown, which tells me they may add another perimeter wide receiver. It would directly impact his target upside if that were to happen, and not as much Tyler Lockett. Because of that, Lockett is the safer pick this year, though it's Metcalf who has the higher ceiling.                                                </div>

Some may think that's absurd, but Marlon Mack totaled 247 carries in just 14 games last year. Even if we give Mack the 100 carries that Jordan Wilkins and Jonathan Williams combined for last year, it'd leave room for Taylor to hit the 250 mark. He's also running behind the best offensive line in football, so it wouldn't be a shock to see him rush for 1,200 yards in year one with his vision and speed in the open field. Taylor is right in the same territory as someone like Nick Chubb.                                                </div>

Like, one of the best of this generation. Or how about Drew Brees, he's been extremely good and consistent throughout his career. What happens when we look at them and Prescott side-by-side? Prescott's numbers have been just as good, if not better. He's never finished outside the top-12 quarterbacks and is about to play in the same system that just netted him the QB2 finish. Did I mention he also had CeeDee Lamb added to his arsenal? And do you remember all those years we drafted Aaron Rodgers as the top quarterback? That was with Mike McCarthy as his head coach (Prescott's new coach). If you're on the clock and choosing between Prescott, Kyler Murray, Deshaun Watson, and Russell Wilson, I'm choosing Prescott. There's the least number of variables with him, though Wilson is close. I'll leave you with this: Since Amari Cooper joined the team, Prescott has completed 616-of-916 passes (67.2 percent) for 7,369 yards (8.04 yards per attempt), 44 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. That's over a span of 25 games. He's also rushed for 346 yards and seven touchdowns.                                                </div>

I remember last year on the podcast talking about Parker, saying there's a clear avenue for him to see 100-plus targets and that if Fitzpatrick was starting, I wanted him on my roster. Here we are 128 targets and a No. 7 wide receiver finish later. Fun fact: Parker and Michael Thomas were the only two receivers who posted at least 55 yards in 13 games last year. You were able to get Parker outside the top 60 wide receivers last year, something that isn't happening this time around. His current draft position is right around WR20-22, so you're receiving a discount from last year's production, and rightfully so. Preston Williams is back from his ACL injury, which isn't great news for Parker, who was the No. 34 wide receiver through nine weeks with Williams in the lineup. That was really solid for him considering where he was drafted, but once Williams left, Parker exploded and finished as the No. 2 wide receiver the remainder of the season. Part of the reason that happened was due to Ryan Fitzpatrick's willingness to target him relentlessly, as he averaged 9.5 targets per game over that span. To be fair, Williams is coming back, but both Allen Hurns and Albert Wilson have opted out of the season, clearing up 110 targets from last year. Knowing Fitzpatrick is starting the season under center helps me feel more confident in Parker, but there's certainly hesitation in drafting him this year as the Dolphins defense is going to be much better, which will result in fewer pass attempts, and that they'll be moving to a rookie quarterback at some point. I think he's best viewed as a stable WR3 who comes with top-12 upside. If I knew Fitzpatrick would start all year, he'd be a WR2.                                                </div>

Not only that, but he also offered a ceiling, hitting 16-plus points on five separate occasions. The issue with relying on that again is the new competition for targets. As much as we don't want to consider Jason Witten a threat, he's going to steal some targets. Not just him, but Henry Ruggs, Lynn Bowden, and Bryan Edwards are all guys who'll demand some sort of target share. I still view Waller as a top-five tight end, though he's teetering there.                                                </div>

There will be no preseason game action for him to build any chemistry with his new quarterback, so training camp was important. Hilton has never been a touchdown guy, as his career high is capped out at seven touchdowns. So, he's reliant upon targets more than someone like D.K. Metcalf, who can score 10 touchdowns. Not only do we have to worry about Hilton's health and age, but we also have to worry about his quarterback's. Philip Rivers was not good last year and hasn't traditionally thrown to guys like Hilton who are undersized and play on the perimeter. With so many variables and lack of true upside, I'm okay fading Hilton, especially at his current cost. If you're able to land him as a backend WR3, I'm okay with the risk/reward, as there aren't too many safe options in that range.                                                </div>

That argument only holds so much water, as Wilson has now finished as a top-three fantasy quarterback in four of the last six seasons. Let me tell you... if Wilson attempted 600 pass attempts, he'd under consideration as the first quarterback off the board. Despite topping out at 553 attempts, Wilson has thrown at least 31 touchdowns in four of the last five seasons. There's been just one season he's averaged less than 7.7 yards per attempt. He's hit a 6.0 percent touchdown percentage in 6-of-8 career seasons. He's the good stuff. Can we anticipate more pass attempts? Sure we can. The first year under Brian Schottenheimer they threw the ball just 427 times. The second year (2019), that number went up to 516 attempts. Why did that happen? Not because the run game wasn't effective. It certainly was. It's because the Seahawks defense has trended in the wrong direction, which bodes well for Wilson's pass attempts. They did just trade for Jamal Adams, which will certainly help matters, but their front seven doesn't generate a whole lot of pressure. If they lose Jadeveon Clowney, it only gets worse, but I'd consider 516 attempts the floor for Wilson in 2020. When you add in the growth/chemistry between Wilson and D.K. Metcalf, the ceiling continues to grow. Don't forget that Metcalf was a rookie last year, while Tyler Lockett dealt with injuries over the second half of the season. I can't say Wilson gets to 600 pass attempts, but we don't need him to in order to produce elite numbers, as we've seen. Provided he's healthy, his floor is likely a top-six quarterback, something not many can say.                                                </div>

In the first year of Kliff Kingsbury's offense, he averaged just 6.9 yards per attempt. While it was his rookie season, the Cardinals also had the element of surprise, in that no one had existing tape on the offense. Adding DeAndre Hopkins surely helps his chances, though. Did you know there were six games that Murray didn't throw a touchdown last year? Based on where his pass attempts and rushing attempts took place, Murray should've scored the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks last year. Natural progression to his career should improve efficiency. If you're looking for upside, he's got it. He belongs in the same tier as guys like Dak Prescott, Russell Wilson, and Deshaun Watson. The difference between him and those guys? They've proved to be top-three fantasy quarterbacks already.                                                </div>

Diggs actually led the league in yardage on passes that traveled over 20 yards in the air last year. The Bills are still a run-first team that has a top-tier defense, so it's hard to expect a big jump in pass attempts. They targeted their wide receivers 310 times last year, which was a lot for a team that threw the ball just 513 times. The 60.4 percent target share was the fourth-highest mark in the league. So, again, it's tough to say there will be more to go around. Knowing that John Brown was fantastic last year (115 targets), as was Cole Beasley (104 targets), it's tough to take targets away from them, but we have to start taking them from someone because you don't trade for someone like Diggs and not target him. Still, giving him even 115 targets might be too generous, as it'd completely crush the value of Brown, who already has experience with the quarterback/offense. Realistically, I have Diggs down for 111 targets in my projections. When tied to Allen's inconsistencies, that is a WR3 in fantasy who can get into WR2 territory at year's end, similarly to the way Brown did last year. Diggs is probably a top-eight wide receiver in the league, but you need to targets to move up the boards in fantasy football. I'd be happy landing him as my WR3, but that's about it.                                                </div>

Despite the fact that Ingram had more than 15 carries just twice all season, he finished as the No. 8 running back. We aren't banking on that happening again, especially when the Ravens drafted JK Dobbins in the second round of the NFL Draft. Ingram is going to be 31 years old this year, while Dobbins and Justice Hill have young, fresh legs. We could see Ingram lose a few carries a game, but provided he's healthy, we should still expect him to lead this timeshare and be a borderline RB2.                                                </div>

We've never seen Watson without Hopkins, which certainly does raise some questions, but it also could provide an outlet for even more rushing yards for him. Watson maneuvers the pocket extremely well and buys himself time to find open receivers. Now without his safety blanket in Hopkins, we could see his rushing ceiling go up. Did you know he rushed for at least 32 yards in 9-of-15 games last year but never topped 47 rushing yards? That's odd, to say the least. The Texans defense will be as bad as it's ever been with Watson under center, which should mean even more dropbacks. The reason I'm still okay drafting Watson as a top-six quarterback: He's only thrown 26 touchdown passes in each of the last two years and has still been a top-12 type quarterback in 63.2 percent of his career games, which is the second-highest rate since 2000, behind only Patrick Mahomes. For context, there were just seven quarterbacks who topped 50 percent last year alone. Watson may not have the passing ceiling without Hopkins, but I'm expecting his rushing totals to make up for some of that, leaving him in the top-six quarterbacks.                                                </div>

The reason we have to assume he'll have a role is due to the Browns tendering him with a second rounder instead of moving on. Chubb is the superior play in this backfield, but it's important to note that Hunt has standalone value, while also offering league-winning handcuff value. If Chubb were to miss time, Hunt would be a top-five play.                                                </div>

Sure, A.J. Green is back in the lineup, but drafters aren't high on him, either. Oddly enough, Boyd was a better fantasy asset with Green in the lineup in 2018. Boyd is 25 years old, it's surely not his age. Do people really think that Joe Burrow will be a downgrade from Andy Dalton? That can't be it. Looking at Burrow at LSU, his top receiver (stat-wise) was Justin Jefferson, who put up a stupid 111 receptions for 1,540 yards and 18 touchdowns. Jefferson was his slot receiver. While it's a different offense, we know Boyd saw 147 targets in the first year of Zac Taylor's offense. He's the ideal WR3 who's already proven to be better than that, and if the public is right on Green being "done", then Boyd would be a mega-hit in fantasy.                                                </div>

Julio Jones, Mike Evans, and Landry. The way he got there in 2019 wasn't ideal (posted WR2 or better numbers just 31.3 percent of the time), but it was a horrendous offense. The issue now is that he's coming off hip surgery this offseason. While it seems like his recovery has gone well, that could be something to hold him back from being as consistent as he's been the last few years in Cleveland. Another hurdle is the limited targets that may be available in Stefanski's offense. The Vikings receivers combined for just 201 targets last year, and it would appear the Browns are trying to recreate that offense with both Austin Hooper and David Njoku in 2TE sets, while using the run game heavily. There's been just two times in Landry's career where he's finished with more than 7.0 yards per target, and he's scored more than six touchdowns just once. If he's cut down anywhere close to the 100-110-target mark, which seems very likely, it's really going to hurt his fantasy impact. Because of that, he's a WR3, and one who might be a bit dicier than in past years.                                                </div>

This is your reminder that Singletary had just two carries inside the five-yard-line all year, while Josh Allen had five, and Frank Gore had 11.

Since 2000, here's the list of wide receivers who've posted WR2 or better type numbers at a higher percentage than Green: Michael Thomas, Julio Jones, Antonio Brown, and Odell Beckham. That's the end of the list. He's played his entire career with Andy Dalton. Now moving to Joe Burrow, the quality of the targets should improve. You could argue that Green didn't have a chance to work with Burrow this offseason, but that's the case with all of Burrow's new group of pass catchers. There is legitimate top-10 upside with Green, which is extremely hard to find where he's being drafted. There's risk, but with where he's being drafted, it's worth it.                                                </div>

Let it be known that Gallup was one of my favorite receiver prospects in the 2018 draft class. But guys, he's not better than Amari Cooper. It's clear that Gallup benefits from Cooper's presence in the lineup and has fit into his field-stretching role rather nicely. Now, the question becomes: How much does CeeDee Lamb affect Gallup's target share? When Lamb was first drafted, I was concerned, but after sitting down and going through projections, I was still able to find 100-105 targets for him in the offense, which should net him a WR3 finish in fantasy. There are some risks taking him inside the top-30 because you're taking on some of the risk that Lamb doesn't eat into his target share a bit more, though it's a smaller risk knowing we've had a shortened offseason with no preseason action. I have Gallup as a back-end WR3 in fantasy with upside for a bit more if Lamb takes time to develop, which is not out of question. If Cooper missed time, Gallup would be my favorite receiver in the offense and a high-end WR2 start most weeks.                                                </div>

Kerryon Johnson has been solid for the Lions when on the field, though he's had issues staying on the field, and the Lions are tired of bringing in guys like LeGarrette Blount, C.J. Anderson, and Bo Scarbrough. So, they'll likely work both running backs to keep them healthy and fresh. I do believe Swift is the better back, hence the higher ranking, but expecting more than 12-14 touches per game out of the gate would be a mistake.                                                </div>

Same calendar year surgery on foot/ankle never goes well for pass catchers. Still, Brown went out there and played well the first two weeks, racking up 253 yards and two touchdowns over the first two weeks. Unfortunately, the injuries to his lower body added up as the year went on and his performances reflected that, as he topped 50 yards just once over the remaining 12 games he played. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman has said Brown's "had a great offseason." Brown's schedule is great to start the year, too. In Weeks 2-5, he'll play against the Texans, Chiefs, Washington, and Bengals. The upside to Brown is a DeSean Jackson-like presence of someone who won't be a consistent WR1, but rather one you play as a WR2/3 who gives you "boom" potential on a weekly basis. However, if the Ravens don't up their pass attempts, it'll be hard figuring out when those booms will come. Relying on him as more than a WR3 this year would probably be a mistake, because there's not much evidence suggesting they'll throw the ball a lot more than they did in 2019.                                                </div>

I've tracked all tight ends since the start of the 2000 season and Engram has posted TE1-type numbers in 58.8 percent of his games. The only players with higher percentages over that time are Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski, and George Kittle. Engram hasn't had the upside of someone like Jimmy Graham or Tony Gonzalez, but he's been reliable. Now in an offense with more weapons than ever, will that continue? Even with most of them on the field last year, there was just one game where he saw less than seven targets (he still saw five). Do you know how many tight ends averaged more than even 6.5 targets last year? Six. Engram averaged 8.5 targets, so even if we knocked off a full 1.5 targets per game, he'd still be in elite territory. Injuries have added up, though, and he's missed 13 games over the last two years, which is why he doesn't belong in the elite conversation. You need a discount to take players like him. Fortunately, you're getting that, as he's the eighth tight end to come off draft boards in the seventh round.                                                </div>

But what happens when your whole world is flipped upside down? Losing Tom Brady is going to affect Edelman more than anyone, as those two had a connection and were continually on the same page. The Patriots also threw the ball 620 times last year, a number they won't even come close to in 2020. It's a different offense, yes, but did you know Cam Newton has never thrown more than 517 pass attempts in a single season? He's also failed to throw for more than 3,869 yards since his rookie year and has thrown more than 24 touchdowns just once. Meanwhile, Edelman has never averaged more than 7.9 yards per target. What does that mean? Even if he were to get 125 targets, his career-best wouldn't have totaled 1,000 yards. There's a lot of issues and question marks surrounding Edelman, and we haven't even discussed him turning 34 years old this offseason. He's likely to post low-upside WR3 numbers when on the field, but that's been a chore in itself, as he's played all 16 games just three times over his 11 years in the league. If you take the late-WR approach in drafts, it's not the worst thing to have Edelman as your WR3, but ideally, he's your WR4 with all the question marks and lack of upside.                                                </div>

What we didn't know was that they'd take one with their first pick in the draft. While Darrell Henderson is a threat to Akers' overall workload, they clearly know what they have in Henderson, and drafted Akers early. It seems like Henderson is going to be the lesser part of the timeshare, while Akers is the early-down back and likely to receive goal-line work. There's a chance Henderson has a bigger role than anticipated, which prevents us from trusting Akers as anything more than a high-end RB3.                                                </div>

The issue is that they are getting Jerick McKinnon back, still have Tevin Coleman, and Jeff Wilson. The passing game also got a new weapon, which could lead to slightly more pass attempts. Despite being on the roster the past two years under Shanahan, Mostert has received 171 carries in 25 games. It's tough to see that changing drastically. There's a chance, which is why he's in the high-end RB3 conversation, but there's also a chance you can't start him with confidence every week.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Did you know that 36.4 percent of Allen's fantasy production came on the ground last year? His nine rushing touchdowns were the sixth-most all-time, while his 631 rushing yards ranked 18th on that list. According to where his carries took place on the field, he scored 30.97 more fantasy points than he was supposed to on the ground alone. As a passer, he scored 1.66 fewer fantasy points than expected. The Bills want to play solid defense with a ball control style offense, and knowing Allen's strengths, they'll be running the ball quite a bit. The addition of Zack Moss to the backfield will lower Allen's rushing touchdown ceiling, as Moss is a better version of 2019's Frank Gore. Not many realize Gore ranked 13th among running backs for carries inside the five-yard-line. Adding Stefon Diggs will certainly help his choices when scanning the field, but Allen needs to get better completing the deep ball. My issue with Allen is his inconsistency, and I can best explain it with this stat: It took 18.6 fantasy points on average to finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2019. Allen hit that mark just 43.8 percent of the time, which was worse than Ryan Fitzpatrick, and the same percentage as Jared Goff. Sure, the booms will be bigger with Allen than those guys, but he's not someone you want to put in your starting lineup every week.                                                </div>

And lastly, he was at just 18.8 percent in 2017, the ninth-lowest mark. Meanwhile, he'll give you big games here and there while not completely tanking your team. If you want to wait at wide receiver in your draft and play him as your WR3, it's not that bad.                                                </div>

Injuries certainly helped Higbee get more targets as the year went on, but are we certain it'll continue in 2020? If you don't have to spend a pick in the top five or six rounds to get him, it's worth finding out.                                                </div>

So, are we supposed to expect another QB2 finish this year? The bad news is that Ryan offers nothing on the ground. The good news is that he's played under Dirk Koetter in four separate seasons and has finished top-8 in pass attempts in each of them. It also doesn't hurt throwing to Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, and now Todd Gurley and Hayden Hurst. Knowing there isn't any running back depth behind the trending-downward Gurley, it seems more likely than ever that Ryan chucks the ball up 620-plus times. His weekly floor won't be as high as some of the top-six quarterbacks, but Ryan is certainly in the next tier. The best part is that you get him at a discount because he's not the "sexy" pick that someone like Josh Allen is. He's my No. 7 quarterback and I feel pretty good about that.                                                </div>

Fuller's volume will be there when he's in the lineup, as Hopkins' 150-plus targets have to go somewhere, and Fuller is the only one returning to the starting lineup who has any familiarity with Deshaun Watson.  You must understand the nature of his game before drafting him though. He's finished with fewer than 8.0 PPR points in 20-of-42 career games. He's also finished with more than 20.0 PPR points in nine games. He's been the definition of a boom-or-bust receiver, and one who's been hurt a lot (missed 22 games over four years). Still, with Hopkins gone, Fuller should see a bump in targets and become a bit more stable. If he's healthy, you should have zero issue plugging him in as your WR3 with top-10 upside. You're getting a discount due to his health concerns.                                                </div>

No matter who is under center, they're not going to be throwing the ball a lot. Tyrod Taylor has never attempted more than 436 attempts in a season, and Justin Herbert is a rookie who'll go through growing pains. We already saw Henry being somewhat scaled back in this offense last year, as he failed to top 45 yards in each of the last five games. For a guy who's never topped 652 yards in a season and getting a downgrade at quarterback, he has a high draft price, and is likely not going to live up to expectations.                                                </div>

Julio Jones, Mike Evans, Jarvis Landry, Michael Thomas, DeAndre Hopkins, Antonio Brown, Davante Adams, Amari Cooper, and... Cooks. He's done that with three different quarterbacks, and it's hard to say Deshaun Watson is a downgrade. The lack of offseason might prove to be a lot for the chemistry between the two, but knowing Cooks has transitioned well in the past, it shouldn't take too long. Concussions, on the other hand, are a big worrisome point. He only missed two games due to concussions in 2019, but they're starting to add up. It also affected his performance (clearly) in a big way, as he never topped 46 yards in the six games following the injury. There's going to be one of Will Fuller or Cooks who shines as a top-30 receiver with top-20 upside, yet neither are being drafted there. Knowing Cooks has been in this situation before, he gets a vote of confidence. If you land him as your WR4, you should be psyched. If Fuller misses any time, he'd be a must-play WR2 nearly every week.                                                </div>

Did you know that Cohen posted RB1-type numbers in 31.3 percent of his games in 2018? That ranked 12th among running backs. His lack of big plays crushed his hopes in 2019, as he went down to just 6.3 percent. Still, his floor stayed intact, highlighting he's still the same player. There's an in-between 2018 and 2019 outcome that's likely in 2020. He's never going to be a workhorse running back, but he's going to beat his current ADP.                                                </div>

The Steelers liked him so much, he saw a very-high 18.0 percent target share in his rookie season. It didn't hurt that JuJu Smith-Schuster was hurt and missing some time, but it highlights how much they believe in him. He'll play the "Antonio Brown role" in the offense moving forward while Smith-Schuster goes back to the slot. The downside is that Johnson will then see the opposing No. 1 cornerback, as they don't go into the slot very often. Still, throughout Ben Roethlisberger's long 15-year career (excluding 2019), he's supported two top-40 wide receivers in 12 of them, with 11 of them supporting two top-32 receivers. There is certainly risk with Roethlisberger's elbow, but at WR43 (his current ADP), you're getting a slight discount. I mean, even with Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges under center, he finished as the WR43 his rookie season. Snagging him as your WR4 would be a good idea, as I believe he'll be a WR3 more often than not.                                                </div>

He was No. 16, actually. Did you know he's the only one who didn't finish as a top-26 wide receiver? His No. 31 finish was better than most would anticipate, though it was uglier than you'd like it to be. In fact, he produced WR3 or better numbers just 43.8 percent of the time, which ranked 42nd among wide receivers. He also scored fewer than 8.0 PPR points in 43.8 percent of his games. With that being said, he's the only receiver returning to the starting lineup for Sam Darnold. Both Breshad Perriman and Denzel Mims are new faces who are going to require time to learn the new offense and develop chemistry with Darnold. Crowder's targets aren't likely to go anywhere. In fact, they might actually go up, which is kind of crazy. Crowder doesn't offer top-15 wide receiver upside, but he does present some stability as a mix-and-match WR3/4 type who presents a solid floor in a pinch. His current ADP of WR49 allows you to get him as your WR5 in some situations, which is fine if you need to add some balance to your high-upside team.                                                </div>

Despite playing just 13 games last year, Kirk saw 107 targets (132 target pace over 16 games). The issue is that Hopkins will get a large chunk of the pie, and Larry Fitzgerald didn't return to play another season to see just 50 targets. It'll be hard for anyone to correctly predict the target share among these receivers, but Kirk is an ascending talent who's entering year three of his young career. Knowing the Cardinals receivers combined for 368 targets last year, it's hard to see a scenario where Kirk sees more targets than he did last year, especially when you know they run a lot of 4WR sets (which cuts into the overall target pie). Kirk has also scored just three touchdowns in each of his first two seasons, so touchdowns aren't likely to make up for a lower target share. He's likely going to be somewhat of a hit-or-miss WR3/4 in 2020 with inconsistent targets.                                                </div>

The Falcons didn't even make an offer to Austin Hooper but decided to spend a second-round pick to acquire Hurst from the Ravens. It's clear they view him as someone who can step right into Hooper's role. It may take some time for Hurst to get acclimated to the new offense with a shortened offseason, but Hooper's role was massive last year. He totaled 97 targets in just 13 games, which was a pace of 119 targets on a full 16-game season. Did you know that of the 116 tight ends who've seen more than 85 targets the last 10 years, that 97 of them finished as top-12 tight ends? That's an 83.6 percent success rate and it seems highly likely that Hurst is going to hit that. Move that number up to 90 targets and it's a 92.4 percent success rate. One of my bold predictions this year is that Hurst finishes as a top-five fantasy tight end. Don't think he was bad because he was playing behind Mark Andrews, one of the best tight ends in the league.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">The end of an era. Crazy to write Brady's name under the Bucs, but hey, this might be the least crazy thing about 2020. He's going from Julian Edelman and Mohamed Sanu to Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. That should help his shockingly low 6.6 yards per attempt from 2019. Not only that, but 2019 was the first time in Brady's career where he didn't have a touchdown percentage of 4.0 or above. It was also the first time since 2004 where he completed less than 61 percent of his passes. Will the upgrade in receivers help him get back on track, or are we at the end for the greatest of all-time? The Patriots offensive line was not particularly good last year, so when you combined that with Brady's inability to move at all, you get bad numbers. The Bucs offensive line hasn't been good over the last few years, though they were slightly better in 2019, and they did draft tackle Tristan Wirfs in the first round, highlighting the fact that they know Brady needs protection. They don't have a James White/Julian Edelman on the roster to be his safety valve, though I suspect Godwin will become that player to him. Will the pass attempts drop off from Jameis Winston? Probably, but know that Bruce Arians has not fallen out of the top 20 in pass attempts since back in 2010. His teams have now been top-five in each of his last three years as a coach. Knowing they don't have a running back like Saquon Barkley on the roster, we should expect 580-plus pass attempts, and if you look at the receivers on the roster, and what their career averages are when it comes to yards per target, yards per reception, touchdowns, etc., it's hard to say Brady won't finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2020. There's risk that he's just flat-out done, as well as risk of chemistry with no offseason, but Brady did workout with a lot of the skill-position players even when the NFL advised against it. He's not a top-five candidate, but if you snag him as a back-end QB1, he shouldn't lose you fantasy leagues.                                                </div>

Golden Tate is aging, and while Darius Slayton did flash at times, it was a relatively small sample size. It shouldn't shock anyone to see Shepard get 100-plus targets in 2020 and finish as a WR3, though you do have to wonder what his upside actually is with so many mouths to feed.                                                </div>

The issue with projecting that moving forward is due to his offensive line play. The Dolphins have what may be the worst line in football, while Howard has only run behind top-10 offensive lines while in Chicago and Philadelphia. Still, if you need a running back who's likely locked into 12-plus touches a week, Howard can fill a role on your fantasy team.                                                </div>

Here's the crazy part about Brown last year: He hit WR3 or better numbers in 73.3 percent of his games, which ranked 11th in the league. He only hit WR2 or better numbers in 26.7 percent of his games, which ranked 51st in the league. Now start removing targets to get Diggs his, and we suddenly lose some of that WR3 floor that he had. He is a good football player who just won't get enough targets to start on a consistent basis. Now, if Diggs were to miss any time, we could go back to playing him as a low-end WR2/high-end WR3. Until then, Brown is in the WR4 range for me.                                                </div>

He's likely to get 8-10 touches per game even with Ingram in the lineup, as the Ravens are not going to give any one running back more than 15-16 touches per game. That limits the upside of Dobbins, as does Lamar Jackson stealing plenty of goal-line touches.                                                </div>

He may not have had the Lamar Jackson upside, but you knew he would finish as a top-five quarterback as long as he was healthy. Last year was the first time he finished worse than the No. 7 quarterback while playing at least 10 games. His QB9 finish was worse than it appears at first sight. Rodgers actually finished with fewer than 15 fantasy points in 10-of-16 games. There were four games that essentially carried him through the season, and those games were against the Raiders, Giants, Chiefs, and Eagles. Three of those were among the worst in football. Fortunately, Rodgers has a semi-decent schedule in 2020, as he'll play the Lions twice, Panthers, Falcons, Texans, and Jaguars defenses during the fantasy season. Was it the new offense he was learning? Was it the lack of weapons to throw to? Neither has changed, so it's tough to say he'll return to the Rodgers we all know and love as fantasy players, but his cost doesn't reflect that it's even a possibility, as he's being drafted outside the top-10 quarterbacks. If you're one of those fantasy owners who refuses to spend up at quarterback, taking a shot on Rodgers in the eighth or ninth round would make plenty of sense. He's 36 years old and has seven top-two finishes under his belt.                                                </div>

But for whatever reason, Matt Nagy has chosen not to let Miller flourish in the Bears offense. There were just seven games he saw more than three targets. In those seven games, he totaled 42 receptions for 547 yards, and two touchdowns. With Taylor Gabriel gone, it's very possible that Miller becomes more of a staple in the offense. He's best viewed as a WR4/5-type option with WR3 upside.                                                </div>

Yes, the Browns also picked up the fifth-year option on Njoku's contract, and then drafted a tight end in the fourth round. What a mess. This is a lot like the Vikings duo of Kyle Rudolph and Irv Smith last year. Don't forget that the Vikings paid Rudolph a lot of money (4 years, $36 million) just one year ago, after they had already drafted Smith. Do you know how that situation played out? Rudolph got 48 targets while Smith got 47 of them. The Vikings tight ends combined for 105 targets last year when you add in Tyler Conklin. Even if you want to weight them more towards Hooper, what are you looking at? A 55/40/10 between these three tight ends? The magic number for a tight end to be considered a TE1 is right around 80 projected targets. We cannot get there with Hooper. Njoku and his agent know that this is a bad situation and want out, but the Browns have said they're holding onto him because Stefanski loves to use two tight ends. The best-case scenario with Hooper is that he gets close to the 70-target mark and scores at least six touchdowns, though I don't see it happening. I'm staying away from this tight end unit unless some injuries arise. If Hooper or Njoku were to get hurt, the other would turn into an attractive option.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">In the 17 games that Sanders played last year (no bye week for him with the trade), he totaled more than 33 yards just eight times. In every one of those games, he saw at least six targets. That's going to be difficult to come by during his time in New Orleans. Michael Thomas is going to get a massive chunk of the targets, and rightfully so. You don't want to start taking targets away from Alvin Kamara, either. And judging how efficient Jared Cook was last year, you'd be hard pressed to take away any of his 65 targets from last year. So, where do the targets for Sanders come from? He's now 33 years old and is clearly towards the end of his career. This was a better move from a football standpoint than a fantasy one. Yes, he's getting a big upgrade at quarterback, but you need targets to produce. There was just one game last year where a Saints receiver not named Michael Thomas saw more than six targets. He's a WR5 for me, which means I'll have none at his current cost of WR44.                                                </div>

Gesicki has averaged a measly 6.4 yards per target in the NFL to this point, which is bottom of the barrel, so you can't say that he's the difference maker that Gailey needs to feature.

The issue is stability. With Sterling Shepard and Golden Tate in the mix, it's going to be very hard for Slayton to get consistent targets and be reliable in fantasy. Sure, he had multiple 120-yard, two-touchdown games last year, but you know what else he had... after those games? A game with three targets. Another game with two targets. Keep in mind that was while Evan Engram was out of the lineup. Slayton outproduced what everyone expected last year, being a fifth-round pick, but there's a real chance he's the No. 5 option in this passing attack when everyone is healthy. His average depth of target last year was 14.5 yards down the field, which ranked 10th in all of football. That further indicates a boom/bust player who's being taken as a low-end WR3/high-end WR4. If you want to believe in his ceiling, that's fine, but don't pay for it. He's in the WR4 territory and not as safe as Shepard or Tate. If someone misses time, we saw what he can do if promoted.                                                </div>

Any time a pass catcher has surgery on a foot or ankle in the same calendar year, you have to be concerned, as we've seen players continually struggle to produce. Kyle Shanahan has already come forward saying that Samuel will miss games, and that the only question is how many. This is a bit reminiscent of A.J. Green last year, where I kept telling people to take the discount as your WR3. Oddly enough, Samuel is being drafted in WR3 territory as the WR30 right now. There's no way I'll advise to make that mistake again, especially with a player who has such a limited sample size. He saw 81 targets last year. That's hardly "can't miss" material, anyway. If he falls into the double-digit rounds, he's not a bad gamble, but I wouldn't take him prior to then.                                                </div>

Lamb is coming from the Big-12 where the defenses are pretty horrendous, so the learning curve might be bigger than some expect. On top of that, he's going to have zero game experience with no preseason. It seems very likely that Lamb will start out as a slot-heavy receiver, which should help his transition into the faster pace of the NFL, and it's a role that Randall Cobb saw 83 targets in last year. Keep in mind that was Cobb's first year in the offense, so we should see Lamb reach or exceed that number. But temper expectations in fantasy, as he's clearly the third option this year behind Cooper and Gallup. He's someone who belongs in the WR4/5 conversation. If either of Cooper or Gallup were to miss time, Lamb would be a WR3 start with upside for more.                                                </div>

He's best suited for a timeshare role and somewhat of a handcuff to Raheem Mostert.

Unfortunately, he averaged just 2.0 yards of separation when targeted, which was the lowest number in football. Williams needs a quarterback who's willing to throw it into tight coverage to succeed. We haven't seen Tyrod Taylor play in a little bit, but the last season he was a starter was in 2017. He threw into tight coverage just 15.2 percent of the time, which was the seventh-lowest percentage in the league. In 2016, Taylor's mark was just 14.2 percent, the third-lowest mark in the league. Philip Rivers was at a much higher 17.1 percent last year. Williams is much more reliant on touchdowns to produce than Keenan Allen, which is why you should probably be fading the receiver who struggles with separation, especially now that he's playing with a quarterback who's not aggressive. Rivers has thrown 83 touchdowns in the 48 games since Williams came into the league. Meanwhile, Taylor has thrown 33 touchdown passes in his last 32 starts. Williams should be considered a WR4, at best.                                                </div>

In fact, the closest tight end, Travis Kelce, has posted those numbers in 31.6 percent of his games. While Gronkowski isn't the young stud he once was, but he should be a consistent presence while on the field with Brady.                                                </div>

Here we are, now entering his 11th season at 32 years old. As you can see from the Shepard paragraph, Tate was semi-consistent with his targets, but you also have to factor in where he played on the field. Both Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram missed time throughout the year, which should've led to more targets for Tate. He had them most of the time, but even more importantly, he produced when he played. He produced WR3 or better numbers in 81.8 percent of his games last year. You know who did that more often than him? Michael Thomas. That's it. It is a new offense and Barkley/Engram are healthy, so don't expect that anymore, but understand that there's likely a place for him in fantasy football, especially when you consider the state of the Giants defense that'll be among the league's worst. He's not sexy and won't finish as a top-24 receiver, but he can be a WR4 type that you plug in when you know the Giants will be throwing a ton.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Here's a fun fact: Jones had two of the top-10 single game performances by quarterbacks in 2019. Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson are the only two other quarterbacks who can say that. In fact, Jones had four games where he tallied 28-plus fantasy points, including three games over 30 points, something Philip Rivers has never done in his career. It wasn't all pretty, though. Outside of those four explosion games, Jones was a train wreck, finishing with 14.7 or fewer fantasy points in the eight other games he started. His matchups where he exploded were against the Washington Football team, Bucs, Jets, and Lions. That's a far cry from his start to the season in 2020 where he'll open the season against the Steelers, Bears, and 49ers. You're going to find him on waiver wires before long. In fact, he has one of the toughest schedules in the league, though the start is just brutal. What his 2019 season reminded me of was 2018 Mitch Trubisky. Don't believe me? The stats highlighted in The Primer: Draft Day Edition back that up. Now to be fair, Jones is under a new head coach, though Jason Garrett may not be a better play caller than Pat Shurmur. On top of that, Jones never got the luxury to play with Saquon Barkley, Evan Engram, Sterling Shepard, Golden Tate, and Darius Slayton on the field at the same time. The upside is certainly there for Jones to take the leap into top-12 quarterback status, but the early schedule means you shouldn't draft him in 1QB leagues, unless you plan on platooning quarterbacks. In 2QB formats, he's the ideal solution, as he has job security, rushing upside, and his defense is horrendous.                                                </div>

Then you add in Roethlisberger, who's been rehabbing from an elbow injury that had him tear three tendons in his throwing arm. Yikes. His teammates have said he looks good while throwing the ball around, and have also said he's lost weight, and looks lighter on his feet. Many are undervaluing the Steelers this year due to what happened last year, but don't forget they averaged 66.4 and 66.1 plays per game in 2017 and 2018, while averaging just 58.6 plays per game in 2019. That amounts to an extra 120-plus plays for this offense with Roethlisberger back. The pass attempts dropped from 687 to 510. While that 687 number from 2018 was sky-high, the Steelers continually have averaged 585-610 pass attempts. We can talk about Roethlisberger throwing at least 26 touchdowns in six of his last eight seasons and that he's averaged at least 7.5 yards per attempt each year from 2014-2018, but none of that matters if his elbow isn't right. It adds a level of risk to the entire roster, though he was apparently playing through some elbow pain for quite some time, and it makes sense considering how three tendons finally snapped. We'll talk about it throughout the season in The Primer, but you should also know that Roethlisberger has been horrendous on the road over the last six years, averaging just 15.22 fantasy points per game compared to the 22.19 fantasy points per game at home. He opens the season on the road against the Giants, which is a juicy matchup, but should you trust him coming off the arm injury? I'd probably play it safe and stream him throughout the year once we know he's healthy.                                                </div>

That was despite them having their bye in Week 5, as well as him not being a true starter until Week 3. He was extremely good his rookie year. He's coming off a torn ACL, which isn't an injury that's as detrimental as it used to be, but it may be tough for him to return as the same player in a brand-new offense. The Dolphins defense improved greatly, their run game should be much better, and they'll eventually transition to a rookie quarterback. These are all question marks, but fortunately, Williams is being drafted outside the top 60 wide receivers, similar to the way DeVante Parker was last year. Given their current prices (Williams WR61, Parker WR22), Williams seems like a much better value than Parker this year. Knowing that Allen Hurns and Albert Wilson have opted out, there are plenty of targets up for grabs, making Williams a solid WR4/5 on fantasy teams that you can spot-start depending on matchups.                                                </div>

In that article, I highlighted that every target/carry/pass attempt has an expected outcome in fantasy points. A target on your own 10-yard line isn't worth as much as a target on the opponent's 20-yard line, etc. Each of the tight ends who finished top-12 in opportunity finished top-13 at year's end, so it's clearly something to look for. Based on Hockenson's pace over 16 games, he would've been the No. 12 tight end in opportunity. Now going into his second season, we should see his role grow. Hockenson was one of the least efficient players in all of football last year, and even going over the last 10 years, his 54.2 percent catch-rate ranked 331st among 357 tight ends who've seen at least 30 targets. There's only room for improvement, so if you're looking for a potential late-round tight end, he has more opportunity than most realize.                                                </div>

In fact, he was my No. 3 receiver in this draft class behind only Jerry Jeudy and CeeDee Lamb. He's a very explosive player who can play all over the field and create yards after the catch. Knowing that Marquise Goodwin opted out, Alshon Jeffery looks likely to start on the PUP list, and DeSean Jackson turning 34 years old, Reagor might lead this team's wide receivers in targets. All we've heard this offseason is that Reagor is "everything the Eagles thought he'd be and more." You can read my scouting report on him here. If Jeffery does, in fact, start out the season on the PUP list, Reagor is someone I'm willing to draft with one of my first bench spots, as he has 100-target potential. I can make the case for him to be a WR3 in fantasy, but you don't want to erase all equity.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">I can't explain what happened to Goff after that game in 2018 where the Rams went toe-to-toe with the Chiefs (remember that 54-51 game?) but something happened. In his first 26 games under Sean McVay, Goff threw 54 touchdowns on 858 pass attempts (6.3 percent touchdown rate). Since that Chiefs game in 2018, he's thrown just 28 touchdowns in 21 games on 806 pass attempts (3.5 percent touchdown rate). That's not great for a quarterback who offers nothing with his legs. He did throw two touchdowns in eight games last year but didn't hit three touchdowns until Week 17. Now you take away Brandin Cooks and Todd Gurley, only to replace them with Van Jefferson and Cam Akers? It's quite ridiculous, but the Rams didn't address the offensive line issues, either. Their offensive line was among the worst in football last year, which is a problem because Goff isn't good under pressure. He ranked 25th among quarterbacks with a 60.4 QB Rating under duress. The offensive line is the biggest concern for me, as that's the one thing that took a major step back last year, and it seriously impacted his numbers. The good news is that his pass attempts have been skyrocketing, which help make up for some of the decreased efficiency. Goff makes for a decent No. 2 quarterback in Superflex/2QB leagues, as he's not getting benched, and there's always the possibility he goes back to who he was, though I'm not counting on it based on the moves that were - and weren't - made this offseason.                                                </div>

With essentially no offseason, it's going to be difficult for him to walk in and develop instant chemistry with Drew Lock. At the same time, everyone on the team is learning a new offense, as Pat Shurmur has walked in as the offensive coordinator. Still, it'll be hard for him to overtake Courtland Sutton as the team's leader in targets. Jeudy can play many roles, including being the deep threat down the field, playing the possession-style role, or moving into the slot, which he did regularly at Alabama. Sutton isn't someone who'll move into the slot very often, which is a good thing for Jeudy, as Shurmur's slot receivers have done damage in the past. Again, the negative is that fellow rookie KJ Hamler is also a slot presence who's going to get some playing time. There's a path to Jeudy being a Terry McLaurin-like fantasy option this year, but his path to targets is not as easy. If Sutton stays on the field, Jeudy will be too inconsistent to trust on a weekly basis. He's still not a bad on to have on your bench as a WR4/5, because the talent is there.                                                </div>

This will be his sixth season in the NFL and he's never topped 104 carries in a season despite the fact that he's averaged 4.5 yards per carry (4.91 over the last four years) over his career. Now having to deal with David Johnson, whose best attribute is catching passes out of the backfield, it's unlikely Duke has any value with David healthy. However, it needs to be stated that David has played just 22 full games over the last three years and will be 29 years old at the end of the season. Should he miss time, Duke might get the opportunity that we've been waiting for.                                                </div>

So many fantasy players have seemingly forgotten it typically takes a few years for tight ends to become someone you can rely on. He saw 66 targets his rookie year and ranked 15th in expected fantasy points among tight ends. The discerning part is that he didn't tally more than four targets in any game with Drew Lock. In fact, he averaged just 2.8 targets per game with him, while averaging 4.7 targets per game with the other quarterbacks. We've now watched the Broncos add three talented pass-catching options in Jerry Jeudy, KJ Hamler, and Melvin Gordon this offseason, which won't help his target share go up. On top of that, they selected Okwuegbunam in the fourth round, who happens to be Lock's old college tight end who he loved targeting in the red zone. Fant is still the top tight end on this team, but I cannot say he's a lock to see 70-plus targets in 2020. That puts him outside the starting tight end territory, and knowing his ceiling might be around 80-85 targets, I would probably look elsewhere in the TE10-15 range for someone with true breakout potential.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">The last time we saw Newton on a football field, he didn't look so great. His season was ended in 2019 due to a Lisfranc injury that could affect his mobility moving forward, and he also had shoulder surgery after the 2018 season. In the two full games he played in 2019, he rushed for negative two yards. NEGATIVE. He needs the mobility in order to remain relevant in fantasy. Why? Well, do you know how many times he's thrown more than 24 touchdowns in a season? Once. Jimmy Garoppolo threw 27 last year. I'm not saying that Newton doesn't have any mobility anymore, but rather that he's lost a lot of it. Newton rushed for at least 539 yards in each of his first five seasons. Since then, he's topped 488 rushing yards once (over four years). On top of that, there've been just three quarterbacks who've rushed for 500 yards after turning 30 years old. Sure, Newton is a physical specimen, but that's also what likely led to his injuries, as you're not supposed to be as big as he is and move the way he does. Now you add in a shortened offseason, a new playbook, and new set of wide receivers, yet he's still expected to return to the old days? He's going to try, that much is certain. I'm guessing we get Newton Lite, something similar to what we saw in 2016 where he rushed for 359 yards and five touchdowns. I wouldn't want to draft him with ultra-high expectations, and for what it's worth, his draft position is perfectly fine, as he's going around the QB15 in Yahoo and ESPN leagues. By drafting him there, you have no qualms about cutting him for a streamer if things don't work out. Stidham will be waiting in the wings because you don't sign Newton to sit him on the bench.                                                </div>

Moss is going to crush Devin Singletary's upside, and if Singletary were to miss time, Moss would be a top-15 start every week.                                                </div>

His completion percentage dropped 4.4 points, yards per attempt dropped 0.5 yards, he threw five less touchdowns, and threw seven more interceptions. Wait, I thought Odell Beckham was supposed to help? It's clear that Freddie Kitchens hurt all players involved, as even Nick Chubb was extremely inefficient in the red zone, totaling negative 16 yards on nine carries inside the five-yard-line. Let's just erase that season, shall we? Kevin Stefanski will be the new head coach and play caller. Do we have a lot to go off? Not really. What we do know is that they added two offensive linemen who'll make a difference at the most important positions, as well as add a pass-catching tight end. It seems they would like to replicate what the Vikings did last year under Stefanski, which would be brutal for Mayfield's outlook, as Kirk Cousins threw the ball just 444 times. Mayfield has some mobility but not enough to overcome that low of volume through the air. But knowing that's possible, we know Mayfield could have a lower floor than most would like to admit. He should be treated as an excellent QB2 in Superflex/2QB formats, while being looked at as a streamer in standard leagues.                                                </div>

I'm not willing to say that Henderson is completely out of contention, but his value took a blow in the draft. This is likely to be a timeshare backfield, making him a risky RB3 in redraft leagues.                                                </div>

We saw shades of that and even heard Bill Belichick give him props as one of the top tight ends in the league prior to their playoff matchup. Still, he's going to need more than 3-5 targets per game to get into the TE1 conversation. Despite Walker going down for the year, Smith saw more than five targets just twice all season and finished with 44 on the year. With the offense still projected for less than 500 pass attempts, it'll be difficult for Smith to truly break out. He should be considered a strong streamer in good matchups.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">When someone goes from anywhere in between 6.7 and 7.7 yards per attempt throughout their first six years, then jumps up to 9.6 yards per target, we call that an outlier, especially when said outlier contains just a 286-pass attempt sample size. We can't ignore it, though. Tannehill put his name on the record books, as his 117.5 QB Rating in 2019 ranks as the fourth-best all-time. His 0.67 fantasy points per actual pass attempt ranked as the fourth-best mark over the last 10 years. What made it all that more impressive is that he was sacked every 10.8 dropbacks, which was the third-most often in the league. By comparison, Drew Brees was sacked every 32.5 dropbacks. So, that leaves us saying, "Okay, we know there'll be regression, but how much?" Under Mike Vrabel, the Titans have run exactly 58.8 plays per game in each of his first two seasons as head coach. We know they want to be a run-first team, right? That's why the pass attempts have been 432 in 2018 and 448 in 2019. That's a problem. For the sake of argument, let's raise that number to 500, which would be a massive difference. Even assigning Tannehill a number of 8.3 yards per attempt (Patrick Mahomes' number from 2019), it would amount to 4,150 yards. Then let's say he throws a touchdown on 5.0 percent of his passes (Dak Prescott from 2019). That would amount to 25 touchdowns. So, 4,150 passing yards and 25 touchdowns while comparing him to Mahomes and Prescott, while raising his pass attempts up to 500? Do you see why it makes little sense to think Tannehill even approaches top-10 territory? By comparison, Tom Brady threw for 4,057 yards and 24 touchdowns last year - he was hardly usable. Treat Tannehill as a streamer and you'll be happy. He's a great No. 2 quarterback to have in Superflex/2QB leagues because he's locked into the job and has shown top-five upside, even if it's highly improbable.                                                </div>

However, that's not his best attribute. He's slippery in the open field, takes great angles and utilizes his speed to get away from defenders. The best thing to do is get Ruggs the ball in his hands and let him create. Did you know that Jerry Jeudy had more than double the deep-ball receptions that Ruggs did while at Alabama? It's because Ruggs was used a lot on screens and reverses. Putting him in the slot will manufacture touches to get the ball in his hands and let him create. He shouldn't be pigeonholed to the slot, and I don't think he will be, but playing there is not a bad thing. Did you know slot targets are worth 10.8 percent more than perimeter targets? Seriously, I've done the research (can be read here). On top of that, Derek Carr had the lowest average depth of target among quarterbacks last year, so should love someone like Ruggs who creates after the catch. When a team spends a No. 12 overall pick on someone, they're going to find ways to get him the ball, so finding out the slot is his primary home makes you feel better about his potential in year one. I'd say his floor should be around 70 targets with a ceiling of 100 targets. He should also get some carries mixed in. Because of that combined with his one-play upside, he's worth WR3 consideration. Fortunately, you don't have to use a high pick on him, as he's going around the 11th-12th round. Even if you reach a round or two, I don't think you'll be disappointed if you have him on your roster as a WR4 with tremendous weekly upside.                                                </div>

He played the big-slot role for them, which is something the Vikings should take into consideration when figuring out how to best deploy him. Unfortunately, Jefferson wound up on the COVID list and is being forced to miss a lot of camp. Still, he's a route-running technician who's playing behind a 30-year-old receiver who's been dealing with back issues. There's an avenue where Jefferson is relied upon as a rookie more than most think, though it would likely require Thielen to be out of the lineup. Under Gary Kubiak/Kevin Stefanski last year, the wide receivers saw just 43.2 percent of the target share (4th-lowest mark in the NFL), making it very difficult for multiple options to be fantasy relevant on a week-to-week basis. Because of that, Jefferson is essentially just a wide receiver handcuff.                                                </div>

The Patriots spent a first-round pick on him, so he'll be given every opportunity to succeed, but they won't allow him to be inefficient much longer with Damien Harris waiting in the wings. Michel simply hasn't been the player we watched at Georgia. It's hard to see losing Tom Brady actually help him become more efficient. Not only that, but he now has to worry about Cam Newton stealing goal-line touches.                                                </div>

They've combined for 186 receptions, 2,096 yards and 25 touchdowns in that time. Now, we get Philip Rivers, the guy who's supported a top-11 tight end in all but one season in his long career, yet none of the Colts tight ends are being drafted in the top 18 at the position? The logical one is Doyle, who has now seen 105 targets in 22 games under Frank Reich. Burton is similar in the way that he's more of a move tight end while Doyle is the traditional one who'll be on the field most of the time. In a year where the Colts threw the ball just 513 times, it's good to see Doyle with at least four targets in 12-of-15 games. If you want to wait at tight end and search for a potential every-week starter, Doyle makes some sense.                                                </div>

It sounds crazy, and it probably is. However, I don't know if I've seen a quarterback with Burrow's confidence and swag come into the league in a long time. He's also walking into a situation where he has one of the best wide receiver depth charts in the league (when healthy). The offense that Zac Taylor ran last year presented plenty of opportunity, as Andy Dalton finished with the 12th most expected fantasy points despite missing three full games. He threw the ball at least 36 times in 11-of-13 games, including three games with 50-plus attempts. The offensive line is a problem, though it helps he'll get last year's first-round pick Jonah Williams back at left tackle. While the pass attempts and talent at wide receiver are great, what should attract you to Burrow is his willingness to run with the ball. Sure, he broke records as a passer at LSU, but he also rushed for nearly 800 yards and 12 touchdowns over the last two years. That adds breakout potential to a quarterback, so when you combine that with his arm talent, he makes for an ideal QB2 in fantasy. The Bengals defense is in a complete rebuild mode, and while they've added talent this offseason, it'll take time for them to come together. They allowed 26.2 points per game last year (8th most), so if they continue to struggle, Burrow could become 2020's version of Jameis Winston.                                                </div>

With Witten gone, a lot of targets are up for the taking in Kellen Moore's obviously tight end friendly offense. Over the last two seasons, Jarwin has seen a total of 77 targets, turning them into 58 receptions for 672 yards and six touchdowns. That's 132.2 half PPR points, which would've ranked eight among tight ends. While he may not be as efficient, it's extremely likely that he sees at least 77 targets this season. Think about it... sure, CeeDee Lamb might see more than the 83 targets than Randall Cobb did last year, but not that many more. Even if Jarwin sees just the 83 targets that Witten left behind, he'll be a top-12 tight end in 2020. With where he's going in drafts, it's a no brainer to take him as a late-round upside pick. With all the mouths they have at wide receiver, it's tough to see a top-three ceiling, but hey, we aren't looking for that.                                                </div>

He's played four years of college and pro football, and here are his touch totals (most recent first): 30, 40, 33, and 0. He's been highly efficient on almost all of those touches, but at some point, you have to ask yourself why he's not getting more. Seriously, his efficiency last year was out of this world. Here are some stats for you from my 175 interesting facts from the 2019 football season article: 
-	Among wide receivers who've seen at least 30 targets, Mecole Hardman's 13.1 yards per target ranks as the third-highest mark among wide receivers over the last 10 years.
-	Mecole Hardman averaged 2.77 PPR points per target in 2019, which ranked as the fourth-best mark among wide receivers over the last 10 years.
Pretty nuts, right? I'm not arguing his efficiency at all. His performance last year was very Tyreek Hill-esque, and I could see him breaking out similarly to Hill, "if" Hill wasn't on the field with him. It certainly helps that the Chiefs are taking him off special teams to focus on offense, as that's the same thing they did with Hill a few years ago. Drafting him as a WR4/5 could be worth the reward but understand that he might be the No. 5 option in the passing game behind Hill, Travis Kelce, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and Sammy Watkins. For a team that hasn't thrown the ball more than 583 times in Andy Reid's entire time in Kansas City, that directly impacts Hardman, even if he is uber efficient. If he starts playing more snaps than Watkins, that's when you'll see me completely buy in.                                                </div>

I didn't like him much coming out of college as a wide receiver who didn't separate very well, but rather one who relied on winning contested catches. I knew he did that very well, but that didn't mesh well with the risk averse Tom Brady. As for Newton, he's shown the willingness to target his wide receivers with little separation. Look no further than Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess. The last healthy season Newton played, he threw into tight coverage a whopping 20.5 percent of the time. By comparison, Brady only did that 15.2 percent of the time last year and 13.9 percent in 2018. Harry also dealt with some injuries during his rookie season, which prevented him from playing in a full-time role. Will he play over Mohamed Sanu in 2WR sets? Probably not just yet, but he could be a factor in the red zone, where he works best. He's a touchdown-dependent option, but one who won't see enough targets to be relevant if Julian Edelman is on the field. If Edelman misses time, Harry would receive a big boost. He's a bench stash WR5-type.                                                </div>

Not only that, but the Jets are still under Adam Gase, which means there won't be many plays per game (he's been under 59 plays per game in each of the last two seasons). The Jets have what I deemed the toughest schedule in the league for perimeter wide receivers, so even if we see Perriman get the targets, he's unlikely to be efficient with them. He closed the 2019 season with 25 receptions for 506 yards and five touchdowns over his last five games, which will have some intrigued, but my guess is that you'll drop Perriman for a hot waiver wire pickup, as Gase's offense isn't Bruce Arians' and Sam Darnold isn't Jameis Winston. There will be weeks where Perriman snags a deep ball and pays off, but those are the types of players you can find on the waiver wire all the time. I just don't see him getting more than 5-6 targets per game.                                                </div>

It does help, however, when there's a new quarterback on that team, as well as a coach you've played for in the past. Matt Rhule was the coach while Anderson was at Temple back in 2015. The issue is that Bridgewater's strengths don't really align with Anderson's. Bridgewater threw the ball 20-plus yards just 7.1 percent of the time last year, which ranked second lowest in the league. Anderson's skill set just doesn't align with Bridgewater's strengths as a passer, though they may try to force the issue after spending $20 million over two years on Anderson. Not having an offseason to build rapport makes me a bit more concerned, especially knowing we've seen Anderson's effort level best described as "inconsistent" on the field. It's tough to say he'll be a better fantasy option than he was in New York, only now his asking price is much lower. Being taken outside the top 50 wide receivers is a discount worth taking in best-ball leagues, but in redraft, it's tough to say he'll be a consistent contributor. He's the third option, at best.                                                </div>

While I don't disagree, there are plenty of wide receivers who've had bad quarterback play but managed to be useful. Samuel's 0.96 yards per route run in 2019 ranked dead last among the 157 wide receivers with at least 100 targets over the last five years. Heck, his teammate D.J. Moore was able to finish as the WR18. Based on the targets Samuel received and where they took place, he should have finished as the WR16. Look, I'm not saying Samuel is as bad as he was in 2019, but for him to become a reliable fantasy player, he'd have to overcome the fact that he's now the fourth-best target in the offense, behind McCaffrey, Moore, and Anderson. The Panthers also tried shopping Samuel this offseason, but ultimately held onto him. He's someone to look at during bye weeks when the Panthers are double-digit underdogs. Outside of that, you're just looking for an injury to him to become anything more than a WR5-type option.                                                </div>

With Deebo Samuel slated to miss time, Aiyuk is likely to lead the 49ers receivers in targets over the first few weeks. Knowing the schedule starts with the Cardinals, Jets, and Giants, he might get off to a hot start. While watching college film on Aiyuk, he's someone who popped at times, but would then disappear during others. I classified him as more fast than quick, as he is shifty in routes, but lacks elite short-area burst. I thought he'd be a field stretcher who could eventually turn into a complete receiver with some refinement in his intermediate routes. Knowing Garoppolo was arguably the best deep-ball passer in the league last year, that seems like a match. The issue is that the 49ers had him throw deep just 6.5 percent of the time, which was the lowest in the league. We need those numbers to go up for Aiyuk to truly explode. Knowing his early season schedule, it's not a bad idea to snag him as a WR5 and see what happens.                                                </div>

Despite only being a part of the offense in 10 games, Lazard racked up 52 targets last year, including 17 of them in the final two games that he turned into 114 yards and a touchdown. That pace of targets over a 16-game season would add up to 83.2, which is certainly enough to be relevant, and there's obviously room for growth with the departure of Geronimo Allison. Aaron Rodgers has continually gone to bat for Lazard, and that's something to latch onto, as Rodgers did the same thing for Davante Adams back when he struggled at the start of his career. Lazard isn't someone you should rely on for WR3 production right out of the gate, but it's certainly within the realm of possibilities knowing that Rodgers trusts him. If you can land him as your WR5/6, there aren't many in that territory who offer the target upside Lazard does without injury in front of them.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">It was quite miraculous what Minshew accomplished in 2020, especially when you factor in the lack of draft capital (sixth-round pick) they used to acquire him. Don't understand just how good he was? Put his numbers up next to Kyler Murray's. Minshew averaged more yards and passing touchdowns, while having fewer interceptions per game. And keep in mind that Minshew didn't even start two of the games included in that sample. Am I going to say that he should be drafted like Murray? No. However, he is being undervalued by those in 2QB leagues. The average quarterback rushes for a touchdown every 96.2 yards rushing. Had Minshew scored three rushing touchdowns (instead of the zero that he did) on 344 rushing yards, he would've finished as the No. 14 fantasy quarterback... in his rookie season... as a sixth-round pick. The Jaguars defense is as bad as ever, so we'll see plenty of pass attempts out of him. It should also be noted that Jay Gruden (his new coordinator) has produced top-14 quarterbacks in 6-of-9 years, and the years he didn't, there were injuries and/or multiple quarterbacks playing. Minshew has zero competition and can potentially be a Jameis Winston-lite in 2020. He's the perfect target in 2QB leagues and will be streamable quite a bit in 1QB leagues.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">It's never easy to lose your top receiver during the offseason, which is what happened to Cousins when the Vikings traded away Stefon Diggs. They tried to replace him immediately, snagging Justin Jefferson in the first round of the NFL Draft. For a guy who threw just 444 pass attempts and offers no mobility, it's quite an accomplishment to finish as the No. 15 fantasy quarterback, as Cousins did. Now, with Kevin Stefanski out of town, you must wonder if the offense moves towards a more balanced attack under Gary Kubiak, though he may have been the genius behind the offense last year. Still, it's unrealistic to think Cousins throws the ball just 444 times again. Not only is the defense going through a rebuild process, but the Vikings just can't remain that efficient on the ground. Did you know the previous three seasons, Cousins was the (most recent first) QB12, QB6, and QB5? He's trending in the wrong direction, but he's still been a usable streamer in 1QB leagues. I'd be shocked if he's below 500 pass attempts this year, though he is going to become less efficient losing Diggs. Even if we repeated last year's numbers, Cousins ranked 20th in top-18-type performances, which make him a solid quarterback to use in 2QB/Superflex formats. He has no shot to lose the job, likely sees increased volume, and has finished as a top-five quarterback before. Just don't draft him in 1QB leagues as a starter for Week 1, because he's playing the Packers, a team he scored just 8.9 and 6.9 fantasy points against last year.                                                </div>

He's averaged at least 8.0 yards per attempt in every year he's started a game, including 8.4 yards per attempt in 2019. He's completed 67.5 percent of his passes, and he has a 2.10:1 touchdown to interception ratio. Despite all that, he's been a top-12 type quarterback in fantasy just 28.0 percent of the time since joining the 49ers. How is that? He plays for Kyle Shanahan and has averaged just 29.7 pass attempts per game. When you do that to a strictly pocket passer, it crushes his fantasy upside. It's unlikely that changes in 2020, especially when you consider he'll be without his No. 1 receiver for a while, as Deebo Samuel recovers from broken foot surgery. It's worth noting that two of his four QB1 performances in 2019 were against the Cardinals, the team he'll play in Week 1. Again, he'll be without Samuel, but George Kittle might go nuclear. Garoppolo is a solid quarterback in 2QB formats, even if he doesn't come with a top-12 type ceiling.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Does anyone else believe that Watkins may have played through injury in 2019? He hadn't tallied anything less than 8.3 yards per target over the previous four years, and that's despite some subpar quarterback talent in Buffalo and Los Angeles. Knowing that Watkins is the No. 2 option at wide receiver in a Patrick Mahomes-led offense and that he's going outside the top-50 wide receivers is bananas. Sure, he was bad in 2019, but he looked like the player we thought he'd be once they got to the playoffs, as he compiled 14 receptions for 288 yards and a touchdown on 18 targets in their three playoff games. The Chiefs also had an opportunity to move on from Watkins this offseason, but they decided to keep him on the roster. He may not be an every-week option from the get-go, but knowing you have a player tied to Patrick Mahomes who saw six-plus targets in 10-of-17 games last year should carry some weight. Snagging him as a WR4/5 with upside makes too much sense, as we can't let one inefficient year erase what he's been throughout his career. There's an avenue to him finishing as a WR3 without injury in front of him.                                                </div>

What does that mean under new offensive coordinator Joe Brady? That's tough to say, but there's suddenly a lot of mouths to feed in this offense. Christian McCaffrey is Thomas' biggest issue, as there's been just one team over the last four years who've had their top running back and top tight end combine for more than 198 targets. Keep in mind that's the max. It's rare for teams to have that duo combine for more than 180 targets. So, when you see that McCaffrey saw 141 targets last year, that's a big issue for someone like Thomas. You aren't going to take targets away from McCaffrey to feed him. During Teddy Bridgewater's stint as the starter for the Saints last year, Jared Cook finished with 7, 21, 41, and 37 yards, though he did score twice. Those yardage totals are not what we look for out of streamers, and keep in mind there's more competition for targets in Carolina than there was in New Orleans. Thomas is someone you may want to stream from time to time, but I don't see a breakout season with McCaffrey on the field.                                                </div>

It led to nine targets, eight receptions, 154 yards, and two touchdowns. To be fair, it was against Washington, but still impressive. It's tough to take too much away from just one game, though. He is now 34 years old, so it's only a matter of time before his game declines, though we haven't seen it yet. He's averaged at least 10.0 yards per target in six of his last seven seasons. With Marquise Goodwin opting out for the season, they'll need Jackson in the field-stretching role. He's a poor man's version of Will Fuller at this stage of his career but can still fit in your lineup from time to time. At his current WR58 draft position, he's a steal.                                                </div>

He had tremendous numbers when on the field in his earlier years, just like Jackson, who's averaged 5.14 yards per carry over his career to this point. Jackson is going to be fighting for playing time with fourth-round rookie Joshua Kelley this year trying to earn that Melvin Gordon role. It seems likely that the Chargers want Kelley in that role, but is Jackson good enough for them to change their course? It's a situation to monitor, as this will be a run-heavy team.                                                </div>

He's now 38 years old (will be 39 in December), which is the age quarterbacks used to hit their decline (before Brady and Brees came along). Have we reached the end with him? He played behind a bad offensive line last year, something he's done through much of his career. In 2020, he'll play behind a top-three offensive line in football. He has already played under Frank Reich back when he threw for 4,286 yards and 31 touchdowns, then a career-high 4,792 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2015. Does that make a difference knowing it was five years ago? Well, yeah, in a way. The good news is that he at least knows the basics of the offense, which is important this year when we've had practically no offseason. The bad news is that chemistry will have to be built on the fly, and it's even harder when your top receiver (T.Y. Hilton) shows up to camp on the injured list. We did see Jacoby Brissett and Brian Hoyer combine for 22 touchdown passes last year and Andrew Luck throw for 39 touchdowns in 2018, so it's a good offense. If you want to select Rivers in a 2QB format, it could pay dividends, though his fantasy floor might be a bit lower than someone like Gardner Minshew who uses his legs. There are way too many variables to consider him anything more than a streamer in 1QB formats.                                                </div>

If Lock can't get it done with the skill-position players around him now, he never will. The Broncos went out and signed Melvin Gordon in free agency, then drafted top wideout Jerry Jeudy in the first round, speedster KJ Hamler in the second round, then Lock's former teammate Albert Okwuegbunam in the fourth round. Pair them with Courtland Sutton, Phillip Lindsay, and Noah Fant, and you suddenly have one of the most talented rooms in the league. It's tough to judge anything we saw from Lock in his rookie season, as he was asked to start late in the season, and it was a different coordinator. What we do know is that Pat Shurmur is his new offensive coordinator, and he's produced some solid quarterback play in his time. The last time he was a coordinator was 2017 when he coached Case Keenum to a 68 percent completion rate, 22 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions. My concern with Lock is that this is still Vic Fangio's team, and their defense should be very good. If Fangio doesn't give full reigns to Shurmur, we're likely to see a defensive-minded, run-heavy offense, which would cripple Lock's fantasy appeal. The high end for Lock's pass attempts is likely in the 525-attempt range, which isn't great for a quarterback with limited mobility. He's a great target in 2QB leagues, but I wouldn't trust him as an every-week starter in 1QB formats.                                                </div>

Going back through the years with Philip Rivers, there's always been a target over the middle of the field. Whether it be Antonio Gates, Hunter Henry, Keenan Allen, or Eddie Royal. Campbell is going to fill the slot role when T.Y. Hilton is healthy, which isn't a bad thing. And if Hilton were to miss time, Campbell will move around the formation. Fortunately, he's a bigger, stronger, and faster version of Hilton. We haven't seen him play at the level Hilton has, but the Colts did draft him in the second round last year, highlighting their vision for him in this offense. While Hilton remains sidelined and rookie Michael Pittman tries to acclimate to the NFL, Campbell is a dark horse to lead this team in targets. Taking him in the double-digit rounds makes tons of sense, and best of all, you'll find out what you have over the first couple weeks.                                                </div>

The Colts liked him so much that they selected him over Jonathan Taylor (who they then traded up to get a few picks later), so it's clear they love Pittman. They did love Parris Campbell in last year's draft, too, so we can't go overboard. They said the plan is for Pittman to be the "X" receiver in the offense, which should present value with someone like Philip Rivers, who has zero issue throwing into tight coverage, especially when his receiver is 6-foot-4 and 223 pounds. This is your reminder that Mike Williams is 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, while Vincent Jackson was 6-foot-5 and 230 pounds. These are wide receivers that Rivers targeted relentlessly. Mike Williams averaged just 2.0 yards of separation at target last year, the second-worst mark in football. Can Pittman make it into the starting lineup opening day? If so, Rivers could fall in love with his size, particularly in the red zone. He's worth a pick with one of your last few selections, as he's a dark horse to lead the team in receiving touchdowns.                                                </div>

The defense is in a position to allow a ton of points, which does add appeal to Bridgewater. We should see him rack up the pass attempts, and it doesn't hurt to know that his 6.2 intended air yards per target was the lowest in the league, which should mean a lot of short completions to D.J. Moore and Christian McCaffrey. The issue is that Bridgewater offers no mobility after his reconstructive knee surgery. That means he'll have to be more efficient than other pocket passers available later in the draft, guys like Kirk Cousins and Jared Goff. Again, with no offseason, that's going to be incredibly hard to do. Save Bridgewater for 2QB leagues where he's a great target as a No. 2 quarterback with no chance to lose the starting job.                                                </div>

He did see a team-high 109 targets last year, and it's difficult to say his role changed much. He's going to be the safety valve over the middle of the field while DeAndre Hopkins and Christian Kirk work the perimeter. There were just six games that Fitzgerald broke the 50-yard barrier last year, so knowing he scored just four times, you understand the lack of upside despite his decent target share. Still, with Hopkins in the mix, that target share will certainly go down. Kyler Murray threw just 20 touchdown passes last year, so it was tough to expect more than the four that Fitzgerald scored. Even with a bump for Murray, it's tough to say the increased touchdown potential will make up for Fitzgerald's decreased target share. He's just a low-upside bye-week filler at this stage of his career. Even with an injury to someone like Hopkins or Kirk, we've already seen that scenario in 2019, and it wasn't more than a WR4-type.                                                </div>

The difference was their touchdowns, as Rudolph scored six times compared to Smith's two touchdowns. Will that change in 2020? Well, it wasn't due to lack of opportunity, as Smith saw 10 targets in the red zone compared to Rudolph's 11 targets. Touchdowns are a very fickle thing and they can flip-flop this year. Smith is the one ascending up, while Rudolph is moving towards the end of his tenure.                                                </div>

I don't know if he does either, but when a team spends a second-round pick on a running back, they typically have a plan for them. Over the last seven years, running backs drafted in the second round average 172.3 touches in their rookie season. Dillon is just an early-down back, so he'll be extremely touchdown dependent. Knowing how good Jones has been in that role, it's tough to take him off the field, so I'm fine with going the wait-and-see approach with Dillon (and every other non-Jones back in this backfield).                                                </div>

Yes, there are Renfrow supporters out there due to his high yards per route run in 2019, but if he's not running routes, it really doesn't matter. Given there are much more talented options on the roster, he's not someone you should roster. Even if Ruggs were to miss time, Renfrow would be a Cole Beasley-type option, which is hardly exciting.                                                </div>

There's a new offense being installed, but Westbrook should fit Jay Gruden's offense quite well. Remember Jamison Crowder while in Washington? Has seasons with 103 and 99 targets, so it's definitely in reach. We did hear that Gruden plans to use D.J. Chark in the slot a bit more, which tells us that Westbrook won't be pigeonholed into the slot role that he's been the last couple years. Westbrook has real speed on the perimeter and could be more than just a target-heavy slot receiver. We know that second-round pick Laviska Shenault had core muscle surgery this offseason which might put him behind the learning curve, and it's not like the Jaguars have any allegiance to Chris Conley, so it's possible that Westbrook is the 2020 version of Jamison Crowder in 2019 (finished as the WR31) with more vertical play upside. The best part is that you can grab him with one of your last picks and find out almost immediately.                                                </div>

But them drafting A.J. Dillon in the second round screams "he's the guy" behind Jones, and potentially the one even stealing some goal-line work from Jones. Because of that, Williams is not someone you need to draft in shallow leagues. It's best to see how this backfield shakes out before commiting a bench spot on a handcuff.                                                </div>

Still, it was impressive for him to post 735 yards and three touchdowns on just 80 targets considering who was throwing to him. If the Steelers hadn't drafted Claypool, Washington would have sleeper appeal. Heck, he still does, but Claypool clouds his path. It does help that rookie minicamps were canceled and that there is no preseason action, so it's likely we see Washington get the reps out of the gate, and Roethlisberger has always talked good about him. Snagging Washington with a late-round pick might make sense, as you'll find out your answer in Week 1 against the Giants. If he plays the starter role and has a few big plays, you'll see many run to snag him off the waiver wire. On top of that, if Smith-Schuster or Johnson were to miss any time, Washington would likely be staring at six-plus targets per game.                                                </div>

He's now missed 20 games over the last five seasons and appears set to start the year on the PUP list after undergoing Lisfranc surgery in mid-December. You'd think he'd be good to go by now, but with Jeffery, nothing is a given. You can't stash a player on your bench for six weeks in a year like this, though Jeffery does have appeal in best ball and leagues that'll allow you to place him on an IR slot. In his three years with the Eagles, Jeffery has managed to rack up 285 targets over 38 games, which amounts to 7.5 targets per game. That's led to WR2 or better numbers in 42.1 percent of games, which would've ranked as the No. 24 wide receiver in 2019. The Eagles don't have much wide receiver depth/talent, so once he comes back, he should walk back in to at least six targets per game and offer WR3 startability most weeks.                                                </div>

Perhaps a 1B to Harrison Butker this year, Tucker should be one of the first kickers off the board.                                                </div>

Even lowering the bar to a top-18-type performance, he's hit those marks in just 10-of-26 games, and that's why it's tough to rely on him as your QB2 in Superflex/2QB leagues. On top of those struggles, he's now dealing with two brand-new receivers on the perimeter with practically no offseason while playing for Adam Gase. That's like the trifecta of bad. Part of the issue has been the offensive line, though the Jets have tried to address that this offseason, snagging three players in free agency, and then another two in the first four rounds of the draft, including the mammoth of a man, Mekhi Becton, in the first round. That's an issue in itself, as offensive lines take time to develop continuity/consistency, so expecting that to happen with four or five new starters is going to be an issue. Darnold is just not in a position to succeed right now.                                                </div>

But although he may not be built like a workhorse back, he has the potential to be electric in a run-heavy offense. The Titans would be wise to give him 5-10 touches even when Henry is healthy, though there's no guarantee that will be the case.                                                </div>

He's the GM of the Las Vegas Raiders, so when he got the opportunity to sign Mariota, he did. This is not great news for Carr, who has been solid, but not irreplaceable over the last two seasons under the Jon Gruden/Mayock regime. But instead of replacing him, they gave him competition, even if it's one he should win fairly easily. He's going to have a much better surrounding cast in 2020, as the Raiders drafted three skill-position players in the top three rounds of the draft, including wide receiver Henry Ruggs at No. 12 overall. The issue with liking Carr, however, is that he's never going to be an every-week starting quarterback in 1QB leagues; we've learned that by now. He's also not someone you can fully trust as your QB2 in Superflex/2QB formats now that he has actual competition on the roster.                                                </div>

He went on to post his most yardage since 2015. Granted, it took him 83 targets to get there, but he showed that he was capable. Deshaun Watson hasn't been a quarterback to target his slot receivers a whole lot, but he's never had a possession-style on like Cobb, and he's never played without DeAndre Hopkins. Will things change? It's certainly within the realm of possibilities. The issue is that Keke Coutee and Kenny Stills are also solid slot receivers who can fill that role, if needed. My issue with Cobb is... what's the upside? Cole Beasley-type numbers from last year? He even finished as the No. 34 wide receiver, but was any fantasy owner excited to put him in their lineup? Maybe during bye weeks but that's about it. He's just a WR5-type option to me, and one who lacks upside.                                                </div>

He's now going outside the top-60 wide receivers. It certainly doesn't help that he had to have toe surgery and is now missing time with the team. It's nothing major but it does put him at a major disadvantage when A.J. Brown has overtaken the alpha role on the team. When a team has averaged just 440 pass attempts over the last two years, it's tough to find more than one player with value. The wide receivers have averaged 251 targets per season and a 57 percent target share. So, even if we get Tannehill to 480 pass attempts, we're looking at 274 targets for the receivers, and we know Brown is getting roughly 21-25 percent of the overall target share. It does help that Tajae Sharpe and his 35 targets are gone, so we're trying to find a way to divvy up 135-158 targets between Davis and Adam Humphries (and others).  That's enough for him to be reliable at times, especially if Tannehill can maintain some momentum from last year. We also can't forget that if Brown were to miss time, Davis would likely step into that 20-25 percent target share, and as a former first-round talent in a contract year, he could surprise. He has a little bit of a DeVante Parker feel to him, because make no mistake about it, Davis is a good football player. I like him as a late-round bench stash.                                                </div>

If Chris Carson struggles coming off his hip injury, or fumbles again, we could see Hyde in a 15-touch role. He's worth a pick in one of the last few rounds.                                                </div>

Not that they're the same player, but rather people didn't know how good they were until they looked past the school they played for. Mims is a possession-style receiver who can stretch the field, as evidenced by his 4.38-second 40-yard dash he ran at the Combine. He should become a favorite of Sam Darnold in the red zone, as he plucks the ball out of the air with his strong mitts. He'll be battling with Breshad Perriman for targets on the perimeter, while Jamison Crowder remains the safety valve in the slot. Robby Anderson did see 96 targets last year while Demaryius Thomas saw 58 of them (in 11 games), so there's room for a fantasy producer. The issue is that Mims is a rookie who hasn't seen any preseason action and hasn't had much time to be around the team. The same can be said for Perriman, so there's a route to immediate production with Mims, though Adam Gase has not been friendly to perimeter wide receivers. Over the last four years, his top receivers were Jarvis Landry (twice), Danny Amendola, and Jamison Crowder... all slot receivers. It's best to be cautious with rookie wide receivers, especially this year, even if I like who Mims is as a player. Selecting him in one of the final rounds makes sense, as you'll find out what you have over the first two weeks and decide whether you want to cut bait or stick with him.                                                </div>

He's the slot receiver in the offense when they go three-wide, and he's the safety valve for Josh Allen. With that being said, many more plays will be designed to the perimeter in order to get the ball into Digg's hands. That will cap the number of targets Beasley sees, which was at a tremendous 104 last year. Even without Diggs on the roster last year, Beasley produced just two games with more than 14.3 half PPR points, so it's not like you were winning weeks because of him. He was a fine streamer during bye weeks as someone who wouldn't crush your lineup. Lowering expectations to around 80-85 targets, Beasley's floor has been lowered and there will be better options to choose during bye weeks in 2020.                                                </div>

Knowing they invested a fourth-round pick on Kelley, it seems likely that he'll get the first crack at the job. Realistically, it could be a three-headed backfield between them. This won't be the same offense it was with Philip Rivers and we're likely to lose some overall potential from a fantasy perspective. But for now, we should assume that Kelley is the handcuff to Ekeler, even though they're completely different players.                                                </div>

They also said they believe Benny Snell can be that guy if something were to happen to Conner. That doesn't mean McFarland will be chopped liver, but it does mean he's not going to be a 10-plus touch running back without injury. I've compared McFarland to Chris Thompson, which would make sense based on the Steelers' comments on the power running backs. If he gets 6-10 touches per week, he has enough explosion on a per-play basis to make an impact at times, but nothing you want to rely on consistently.                                                </div>

Over the team's final four games, he racked up 36 targets, 20 receptions, 230 yards, and four touchdowns while manning the slot. Sure, Antonio Gibson is the new toy in the offense, but Ron Rivera has already said that he views him as a running back. When Washington goes three-wide, Sims should be out there in the slot, but that's just my opinion. We could see Gibson or even Trey Quinn play that role. Without preseason action, there are just too many question marks. Depending on which receiver is in the slot, he should have some value throughout the year as a streamer, but you shouldn't need to spend a late draft pick on them, as that is your time to take ultra-high upside picks.                                                </div>

Packers tight ends have failed to eclipse 103 targets combined in six of the last seven years. It typically takes 80-plus targets for a tight end to finish in TE1 territory without tons of touchdowns, and though Rodgers has thrown plenty of those, his tight ends haven't combined for more than nine touchdowns in each of those seven seasons. This would be Sternberger's first trip into the starting lineup, so it's tough to expect much from a young tight end, even though I did like him as a prospect last year. He's someone that you'll be able to use as a streamer from time-to-time, but he won't be your every-week solution at tight end.                                                </div>

Although the Kansas City offense offers incredible opportunities for running backs, there is still plenty of competition for touches even with Damien Williams opting out for the season. The Chiefs spent a first-round pick on Clyde Edwards-Helaire and continue to roster Darwin Thompson and Darrel Williams. There's certainly a chance that Washington works his way into decent touches, but given the competition, he shouldn't be drafted until one of your very last picks.                                                </div>

He compliments A.J. Green and Tyler Boyd well, while Tee Higgins would clash with Green. If you don't think Ross is a good football player, I urge you to get on NFL Game Pass and watch him. There were a lot of times he was open for what would've been a long gain/touchdown, but Andy Dalton simply missed him. Insert Joe Burrow, who completed 76.3 percent of his passes at LSU last year, including feather-like touch on his deep ball. Ross saw five-plus targets in 6-of-8 games last year, so it's clear that Zac Taylor felt he could make a difference. With both Green and Boyd healthy, Ross won't be seeing that consistent of targets, but should either of them miss time, Ross would be a plug-and-play upside option. Contrary to belief around the industry, Ross should be selected in one of the final rounds of your draft.                                                </div>

He's not the most physically gifted or athletic receiver, but Higgins continually makes plays look easy. The game simply comes to him naturally. He has a lot of room to grow as a complete receiver, though, so he should be learning and paying attention to Green's habits throughout the 2020 season. Should Green miss time, Higgins would likely get the nod over the inefficient Auden Tate, who finished 23 spots lower than he should've based on his expected fantasy output. Some are expecting Higgins to start as the No. 3 wide receiver over John Ross, but I'm not one of them, especially with the shortened offseason. If any of the starters were to miss time, Higgins would absolutely be worth a pickup.                                                </div>

That makes him worth drafting in most fantasy leagues.                                                </div>

He's going to start for them, and it's possible his value went up with Cam Newton's signing, though it's important to remember Newton has thrown more than 24 touchdowns in his career just once. Still, Sanu tried playing through injuries with the Patriots last year and it affected his production. He may have some bye week streaming appeal if Newton can get his career back on track.                                                </div>

The only hope Armstead has is that Fournette gets traded, which is possible.                                                </div>

Although DeAndre Hopkins is gone, the Texans added Brandin Cooks and Randall Cobb, so it's unlikely that Stills will suddenly have an important role on the team. Given that he's never had more than 63 catches or 931 yards receiving, it's unlikely that he'll be worth rostering this season.                                                </div>

He should similarly be among the leaders in attempts this year with Tom Brady at the helm, and if he can improve on his accuracy, he has a legitimate chance to finish as the top fantasy kicker.                                                </div>

It does help his projection to know that Geronimo Allison opted out, as he's someone who could've stole slot snaps. Despite being targeted five-plus times in 10-of-15 games last year, Amendola topped 47 yards just four times, and it's not as if touchdowns will help make up for that, as he's scored once every 37.9 targets over the course of his 11-year career. He's a last-ditch bye-week option who'll likely have somewhat of a stable floor in PPR formats, but that's about it.                                                </div>

He essentially split targets with Irv Smith Jr. (seeing just 48, his lowest since 2014), and had just 39 catches for 367 yards, both well below his usual numbers. Even without Kevin Stefanski, the Vikings are surely going to be a run-first offense once again, which will leave Rudolph searching for targets for the second straight season, well outside of TE1 consideration.                                                </div>

Knox is someone you might want to stream when the Bills receivers have tough matchups, but even then, it's going to be hard to project more than five targets for the second-year tight end.                                                </div>

After seeing 31 field goal attempts in each of his first two seasons, he saw just 26 last year, and only 11 from at least 40 yards. The Eagles offense should be somewhat better this year if the team can avoid similar devastating injuries to its receivers, which should mean more chances for Elliott. He's a borderline starter in 12-team leagues.                                                </div>

I'm rooting for him, as it's a phenomenal story, but this is Haskins' team for the foreseeable future. Looking at his numbers over his rookie season, they weren't what you'd call good, though if you break them down by week, he was getting better. He threw four interceptions on his first 22 NFL passes. From that point, he threw seven touchdowns to three interceptions over his next 181 pass attempts. It's such a small sample size we have to go off, and on top of that, he has an entirely new coaching staff behind him. For a quarterback who was supposed to take time to develop, there are more changes than you'd prefer. The biggest issue is his offensive line that may not be able to give him more than a couple seconds after trading away Trent Williams. Outside of Terry McLaurin, he really doesn't have any proven commodities in the passing game, either. Generally, when a team has a new head coach, we see them have a big decrease in pass attempts unless they go from a defensive-minded coach to an offensive one. That's not the case here, meaning Haskins is unlikely to throw the ball a whole lot. Let's be real - you're not drafting him in 1QB leagues, and he's not someone you're aiming for in 2QB leagues, either.                                                </div>

He's only played 10 games, but in those games, he's posted TE1-type numbers in 60 percent of them. That's the same percentage as George Kittle in his career. Again, it's a small sample size, but as the 31st tight end off the board? He's well worth the risk. And no, don't worry about Greg Olsen.                                                </div>

The problem for Taylor is that Los Angeles is almost certainly going to lean on its strong defense and rely on its running game, which isn't a recipe for fantasy production from a quarterback. Even if he does hold off Justin Herbert for the full season, his likely low pass volume should hold his fantasy value in check.                                                </div>

He'll likely be the primary backup again to James Conner, but Anthony McFarland Jr. and Jaylen Samuels will still factor in.

Jefferson fits more of the Brandin Cooks mold than Reynolds, which is where there's some hesitance to draft Reynolds in 2020. However, we do have a history that shows when he is in the starting lineup, he produces. In the 14 games he's seen four-plus targets, he's totaled 46 receptions for 613 yards and seven touchdowns. There's a chance he's being underdrafted, but there's also a chance that he remains the No. 4 receiver on the team.                                                </div>

He's been with the 49ers for two years but hasn't played a down of regular season football. Now that they've traded away Matt Breida, there's a role to be had, but we don't know if he's capable at this stage of his career. There's been some whispers that he may not make the team, though that may be a surprise considering they've held onto him this long. Between Raheem Mostert, Tevin Coleman, and McKinnon, it's going to be tough to find consistent volume and production in this backfield.                                                </div>

I expected the Falcons to fill that role with someone in the draft or free agency, but it never happened, so it's possible we see Gage as a bye-week filler on fantasy rosters, especially if any of the other pass-catchers were to miss time. There isn't much upside here, though. Best case scenario is that we're looking at someone like Cole Beasley from 2019. Again, could play a role in fantasy, but don't see a consistent fantasy producer.                                                </div>

At 6-foot-6 and 260 pounds, he can still come down with a jump ball from time-to-time, but he's not someone you should hinge your fantasy season on.

After drafting him in the third round last year, they had him playing behind guys like Seth Roberts and Willie Snead. He played just 27.2 snaps per game and saw just 22 targets his rookie year despite being healthy for all 16 games. He did score three touchdowns on those targets, and outside of Mark Andrews, he's probably the dark horse to lead the team in receiving touchdowns at 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds. Still, he needs to be on the field for that to happen. My guess would be that he starts on the perimeter opposite Marquise Brown with Roberts gone, so there's some sort of opportunity here. The issue is that they targeted wide receivers just 172 times last year. Even a 15 percent increase (which is a lot) would bring them up to 200 targets. Without an injury, it's going to be difficult for Boykin to see more than 50-60 targets, even as a starter.                                                </div>

It may not matter, though. The Jaguars drafted his eventual replacement in Laviska Shenault in the second round of the NFL Draft, so it's only a matter of time before Conley is booted from the starting lineup. Shenault did have offseason core muscle surgery, so it's possible Conley can hold him to start the year, but that's far from a guarantee.                                                </div>

He's going to be stuck in the 4-6 touches per game role unless there are multiple injuries.                                                </div>

The Dolphins bye isn't until Week 11, which is a long time for Tagovailoa to be waiting in the wings. You want to find a soft spot in their schedule to start him, but looking at their schedule, there's only a small window in Weeks 3 against the Jaguars, but that's proceeded by games against the Seahawks, 49ers, Broncos, and Chargers. In all honesty, Week 9 against the Cardinals might make the most sense, as they also get the Jets in Week 10, then their bye week. Whatever the case, Tagovailoa will start at some point. Fitzpatrick was a great streamer in 2019. In fact, he's been a great streamer the last three years. He's started just 23 games in that stretch but has posted QB1-type numbers in 14 of them, or 60.9 percent. Did you know that just seven quarterbacks topped 50 percent in 2019? As mentioned, though, the Dolphins don't have a great start to their schedule. Like most scenarios that have multiple quarterbacks, this is a situation to attack in 2QB/Superflex leagues, as you can snag both of them late in your draft and simply start the one who's under center. Fitzpatrick already showed he can make it work with the players around him, while Tagovailoa was once considered the No. 1 pick over Joe Burrow.                                                </div>

It's fair considering he's seen just 69 targets in that span, but what if Michael Thomas had to miss some time? Smith has averaged a ridiculously high 9.6 yards per target in his first two seasons and can be lined up all over the field. He's also scored a touchdown every 6.9 targets (10 of them on 69 career targets). If you play in a dynasty league and Smith can be had on the cheap, make that move. It's very possible he'd be the top receiver on the team if Thomas were held out, as he has experience in the offense and the Saints have every reason to want him to succeed. Keep him on waiver wire speed dial in redraft leagues.                                                </div>

It's possible Eifert has streamable weeks, but he's not in the every-week consideration.                                                </div>

Even if Humphries were to do something, it's not going to make you wonder how you missed it, because his ceiling is a fringe WR3. Shoot for upside in the later rounds.

He'll battle Mitchell Trubisky for the starting job, but it's worth noting that he has experience with Bill Lazor, John DeFilippo, and Juan Castillo, and could fit in in nicely with the Bears if given a shot. For now, however, Foles remains beyond fantasy consideration.                                                </div>

But did something happen this offseason that could get him back on track to the top-40 receiver he was being drafted as in 2019 fantasy drafts? Geronimo Allison was allowed to let walk in free agency, vacating the slot role once again. Valdes-Scantling seems like the natural replacement, as Davante Adams and Allen Lazard aren't primary slot receivers. That's great news considering Valdes-Scantling has averaged 1.02 more fantasy points per target in the slot than he has on the perimeter. That's the second-highest gap in football over the last two years, so you can say he's slot-dependent. If he can get back on Aaron Rodgers' good side, he'll have some streamer-worthy weeks.                                                </div>

I'll tell you that Hamler is a baller and can play both in the slot and on the perimeter. He's likely going to break a few plays this year that have you wondering if he's worth a pickup, but we must always go back to the fact that he's the fifth option (Sutton, Jeudy, Fant, Gordon all ahead) on a run-heavy team that will only come on the field in 3WR sets. If there's an injury to one of Jeudy or Sutton, he's someone I'd snag off waivers, but you don't need to draft him.                                                </div>

Dobbins essentially relegates Edwards to irrelevancy. He'd almost certainly need multiple injuries to have much fantasy value, and despite the high upside in that unlikely scenario, he's not worth wasting a roster spot on.                                                </div>

Knowing they played together at California State, that's quite the compliment. Still, by statements the team has made, it appears that Edwards is on the outside of the starting lineup looking in at the start of the year, though that shouldn't last long. Here's my final line from Edwards' scouting report this offseason: If he gets an opportunity to play (was projected for 3rd/4th round), he can produce in the NFL. If they're planning on using Henry Ruggs in the slot, Edwards would make a good complement to Tyrell Williams on the perimeter. That would leave Hunter Renfrow out of the equation, as he's pretty much a slot-only receiver. So, again, if they're being truthful about Ruggs in the slot, Edwards should get some playing time immediately in 3WR sets, making him an intriguing pick in one of the last few rounds. You need players like him on your roster who you can cut bait on almost immediately if he's not getting playing time.                                                </div>

Dorsett fits that bill after playing with Andrew Luck, Tom Brady, and now Russell Wilson. With no offseason, it may be difficult for him to get the nod over Moore, but if he did, his skill set would probably fit very well with Wilson. I say that because Wilson completed 48.2 percent of his passes over 20 yards and had a QB Rating of 119.2 on them. While in New England last year, he saw 17 deep balls, though only five were catchable. He caught all of them for 192 yards and three touchdowns. Both are battling for the No. 3 in targets, so it's not like either will be a weekly producer, but Dorsett is the one with the better pedigree, and his skill set aligns with Wilson's strength. If Lockett were to miss time, Dorsett actually played very well in the slot for the Patriots, catching 13-of-14 targets for 218 yards and three touchdowns. He's someone I've snagged quite a few times at the end of best ball drafts.                                                </div>

Clearly, the Bengals did not think of him as Green's successor. It's possible that he's the handcuff to Green because he knows the offense and played that role last year, but it'd only be a matter of time before the rookie Higgins took over.                                                </div>

Pascal averaged 8.4 yards per target last year while playing with Jacoby Brissett and Brian Hoyer, which included five games of 72 yards or more. Knowing that T.Y. Hilton is dealing with a hamstring injury and that Michael Pittman is a rookie, it's possible that Pascal is in the starting lineup. With so much uncertainty around the 2020 NFL season, Pascal could be an early-season waiver wire pickup if he plays 50-plus snaps in Week 1.                                                </div>

He doesn't run a 4.39-second 40-yard dash, but he is very agile for a player who's 6-foot-4 and 223 pounds. The biggest question mark with him is his adjustment to the stiffer competition, as he dominated at Liberty, racking up 2,433 yards and 20 touchdowns over his two years there. Once Kelvin Harmon went down with a torn ACL, it opened a door for Gandy-Golden to play opposite Terry McLaurin and make his mark. With no legitimate tight end on the roster, we could see Gandy-Golden become a favorite inside the red zone. Not that we're expecting Dwayne Haskins to throw 25-plus touchdowns, but we didn't expect anything from McLaurin last year, right? I'll be reporting on his snaps in The Primer after Week 1, so make sure you stay tuned. Given the leap in competition, he may start out behind veteran Dontrelle Inman.                                                </div>

It should be common knowledge that Ryan Pace's job as the general manager was tied to Trubisky. Both his and Matt Nagy's jobs are likely on the line here. When you add in the rushing upside that Trubisky presents, as well as the equity they used to draft him, he might be under center in Week 1, though he'd be on a short leash. With an opening schedule against the Lions, Giants, Falcons, Colts, Buccaneers, and Panthers, whoever is under center should get off to a hot start. Want to hear something crazy? On average, it took 18.6 fantasy points to finish as a top-12 quarterback in 2019. Trubisky hit that mark as many times as Kyler Murray and Tom Brady did. As a fantasy player, you want Trubisky to win the job, as he makes for a better streamer. There's been just two games over the last three years where Foles has scored more than 17.8 fantasy points. Let's be real - you aren't drafting either of these guys in 1QB leagues, but if you want to select both of them to be your QB2/QB3 in 2QB leagues, I actually like that strategy, especially with that early-season schedule.                                                </div>

He continued to be lights out in terms of extra points, converting all 36 of his chances, but that was little consolation to fantasy managers in light of his inconsistency otherwise. Now with the Jets, he finds himself in a far less explosive offense, and isn't worth considering unless he can find his accuracy once again.                                                </div>

I'd argue that Hamilton had his chance to make a dent in the league last year, as he was the clear-cut No. 2 wide receiver behind Courtland Sutton but didn't really earn much with his role. He saw 52 targets but caught just 53 percent of them for 297 yards and one touchdown. The Broncos said no thanks to his 5.5 yards per target through the first two years of his career. He's has more talent than what we've seen, but he's not an enticing option in fantasy football.                                                </div>

The Giants offense should be better this year with Daniel Jones in his second year, but considering Rosas has hit 72% of his attempts or less in two of his three seasons, he's not worth considering on draft day.                                                </div>

Green missing the entire season. It did seem like Uzomah took over as the starter as the year went on, catching 16-of-20 targets for 125 yards and two touchdowns over the final five games of the season. It surely helped that Sample was inactive from Week 11 forward. Knowing that Sample was a second-round pick under this coaching staff, they're likely going to look for reasons to get him on the field. Sample did grade out as a better blocker than Uzomah in both run and pass blocking, too. They're both going to get playing time, but they'll cancel each other out when it comes to upside. Unless one misses time, it'll be a situation to avoid.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Not many realize the Texans tight ends saw a very respectable 19.1 percent target share in 2019, and that was with DeAndre Hopkins on the roster. Knowing the defense is likely taking another step back, we could see increased pass attempts, and a higher target total available. The issue is that Fells and Akins shared the role, though not many realize it was Akins who led them with 55 targets, 36 receptions, and 418 yards. The only thing Fells beat him in was touchdowns, as his seven trumped Akins' two. Based on what we saw out of Akins last year, we should expect the third-year player to take a step forward in 2020, and with a little touchdown luck, he might be an underrated fantasy option. You don't need to draft him in standard 1TE leagues, but you can consider him a streamer in good matchups if my projections hold true.                                                </div>

The Redskins have a new coaching staff that has apparently decided to go with a timeshare approach. Along with Guice, they have Adrian Peterson, Bryce Love, Peyton Barber, Antonio Gibson, and J.D. McKissic. So, even if Guice is the lead back, it's unlikely he's a workhorse, and will concede passing-down work to one of Gibson/McKissic. On a low-scoring team, it's hard to find the upside in Guice's projection, even if he does return to perfect health, which has been an issue.                                                </div>

Although he led the NFL in passing yards with 5,109, he also threw 30 interceptions and completed barely 60% of his passes. Now a backup to Drew Brees, Winston could become extremely interesting with an injury, though the presence of Taysom Hill might negate that potential. There's zero reason to draft Winston in redraft leagues, but his value in dynasty formats would obviously get an enormous boost if he takes over after Brees inevitably retires next season.                                                </div>

If there's someone who can semi-replicate the role that Alvin Kamara plays on the Saints, it's him. He's still a solid pass-catcher out of the backfield, which we know has value in the Saints passing game. If something should happen to Kamara, everyone would flock to Latavius Murray, and rightfully so. Still, Montgomery would have a role that could produce some fantasy points.                                                </div>

We've learned that Allison has opted out of the season, meaning Cephus may be one injury away from starting for the Lions. I'll be honest... Cephus was a top-10 wide receiver in this draft class and I was really curious where he'd land. Knowing Marvin Jones has dealt with injuries over the last few years and that Danny Amendola will be 35 years old in a few months, there's a chance we see Cephus on the field sooner than expected. He's a name to pay attention to should there be an injury ahead of him on the depth chart.                                                </div>

What exactly does that mean? I'm not sure, but it seems he'll be in the mix now that Devin Funchess has opted out. Knowing the Packers wide receivers totaled just 306 targets last year, it's hard to say that their No. 4 option should be drafted, especially when Davante Adams averages 11.0 targets per game over the last two years, but he's a name to keep on waiver wire speed dial in case anything changes. Aaron Rodgers has supported multiple fantasy relevant receivers plenty of times.                                                </div>
