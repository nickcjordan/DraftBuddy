Before you get all worked up, we love Richardson’s dynasty outlook and his landing spot in Indianapolis. But he’s going as a top-10 QB already in BestBall with some major concerns about his efficiency as a passer in Year 1. While his rushing upside is clear, only one rookie QB (Andrew Luck) over the last decade finished as a top-12 while throwing sub 60 percent. There might be some hiccups at the beginning of the year so while we’re totally in on him long-term, we consider him more of a QB2 in 2023. If he doesn’t receive the same hype in your 1QB home leagues, you can still take him as a late round guy.</p>

The offensive coordinator change to Brian Schottenheimer forms a high-T tag team wrestling combo with head coach Mike McCarthy where the objective seems crystal clear: run the dang ball. While Prescott can finish as a top-12 QB again, would you be happy with him finishing as QB11 or 12? He’s quietly increased his turnover rate while his yards per attempt decreased for three straight years. If the Cowboys are committed to running the ball, Dak feels like a safe but low upside option at QB. We take a “swing for the fences” approach to start the year and Dak is just a singles and doubles guy, if we can let baseball metaphors apply.</p>

With his looming legal troubles and the additions of free agent Jamaal Williams and intriguing third round pick Kendre Miller, this is a crowded backfield to sort out. We’ll get more clarity once Kamara’s suspension surfaces but for those thinking they get a major discount at draft time, we disagree. He’s a bench clogger that is being drafted as a top-30 RB only because of his name. Let someone else in your league try to figure out the situation of a soon-to-be 28-year-old RB with declining yards per touch marks with a new QB.</p>

Think of how J.K. Dobbins never truly looked like himself last year returning from his injury. Samaje Perine should begin the season as the starter as Javonte eventually is worked in but it wouldn’t be surprising if he begins the season on the PUP. He’s still a shiny toy and an enticing name for those who want to shoot for the moon but you might be left waiting all of 2023 for him to truly be himself. In 2024, we will probably in again but we consider a bust at his current ADP.</p>

He’s a solid WR2 with all the talent in the world but never has put it fully together to reach top-12 status. While the move to Chicago with Justin Fields might be exciting, the reality might be that this is still a net neutral outcome for him. While Moore ranked sixth in deep targets among WRs in 2022, Fields struggled mightily in that category finishing 28th in adjusted deep completion percentage. Last year, Bears WRs averaged 18 total fantasy points per game… as a unit. In Fields starts, Bears WRs totaled just two weeks (Dante Pettis in Week 6 &amp; Darnell Mooney in Week 9) of over 12 fantasy points! People are expecting more from D.J. likening this to A.J. Brown and Jalen Hurts’ connection in Philadelphia. We caution managers to slow down and accept what he is: a good, not great fantasy WR.</p>

It says he’s playing this year at age 30 but it feels like he’s aged even further in our minds. He hasn’t been a top 12 WR since 2016, nor caught more than 56 % of his targets since 2018. It’s been a while folks especially after sitting out all of 2022 recovering from his ACL injury. The Ravens felt comfortable throwing $15 million his way but it’s hard penciling him in as anything more than the 3rd target in this offense. Mark Andrews is still the target dominator and a healthy Rashod Bateman with do-it-all 1st round rookie Zay Flowers should also eat a large part of the passing pie. Lamar Jackson and this new offense under Todd Monken could increase the passing volume immensely but we’re not betting on OBJ returning to even the top-36 WRs. Let someone else in your league scream with excitement that they got OBJ before you remind them he’s finished outside the top-24 weekly WRs almost 80 percent of the time since 2020.</p>

He was all the rage as a late round TE in 2022 and started the year off falling flat on his face. He was banished to the waiver wire only to resurrect from the fantasy grave as the TE4 from Week 8 on thanks to some multi-TD games. He became 1-of-6 TEs since 2000 to put up a line of 50/500/7 before turning 24 years old. The TDs are the most concerning thing with the arrival of D.J. Moore and Robert “TD” Tonyan in the mix. Kmet was basically the last man standing in 2022 after Darnell Mooney went down and the ghost of Chase Claypool apparently roaming the field. He enters a contract year and we think we’ve seen the best of Kmet thus far. Unless Justin Fields takes a massive step forward from his career 4.1% TD rate, Kmet feels like a low volume, low ceiling option.</p>

He’s a highlight machine and we love watching the passion he plays the game with. But, this is fantasy football folks and Kittle’s end of season run with Brock Purdy was likely a bit of an outlier when you consider his entire career. He had seven TDs over the final month compared to averaging four TDs per season the previous five years of his career. He’s as volatile as they get which can be fun when he’s on a roll but regression can hit you like a ton of bricks. If you’re looking for an every week safer play at TE, you can wait a couple more rounds to take someone at a lower opportunity cost.</p>

Before you get all worked up, we love Richardson’s dynasty outlook and his landing spot in Indianapolis. But he’s going as a top-10 QB already in BestBall with some major concerns about his efficiency as a passer in Year 1. While his rushing upside is clear, only one rookie QB (Andrew Luck) over the last decade finished as a top-12 while throwing sub 60 percent. There might be some hiccups at the beginning of the year so while we’re totally in on him long-term, we consider him more of a QB2 in 2023. If he doesn’t receive the same hype in your 1QB home leagues, you can still take him as a late round guy.</p>

The offensive coordinator change to Brian Schottenheimer forms a high-T tag team wrestling combo with head coach Mike McCarthy where the objective seems crystal clear: run the dang ball. While Prescott can finish as a top-12 QB again, would you be happy with him finishing as QB11 or 12? He’s quietly increased his turnover rate while his yards per attempt decreased for three straight years. If the Cowboys are committed to running the ball, Dak feels like a safe but low upside option at QB. We take a “swing for the fences” approach to start the year and Dak is just a singles and doubles guy, if we can let baseball metaphors apply.</p>

With his looming legal troubles and the additions of free agent Jamaal Williams and intriguing third round pick Kendre Miller, this is a crowded backfield to sort out. We’ll get more clarity once Kamara’s suspension surfaces but for those thinking they get a major discount at draft time, we disagree. He’s a bench clogger that is being drafted as a top-30 RB only because of his name. Let someone else in your league try to figure out the situation of a soon-to-be 28-year-old RB with declining yards per touch marks with a new QB.</p>

Think of how J.K. Dobbins never truly looked like himself last year returning from his injury. Samaje Perine should begin the season as the starter as Javonte eventually is worked in but it wouldn’t be surprising if he begins the season on the PUP. He’s still a shiny toy and an enticing name for those who want to shoot for the moon but you might be left waiting all of 2023 for him to truly be himself. In 2024, we will probably in again but we consider a bust at his current ADP.</p>

He’s a solid WR2 with all the talent in the world but never has put it fully together to reach top-12 status. While the move to Chicago with Justin Fields might be exciting, the reality might be that this is still a net neutral outcome for him. While Moore ranked sixth in deep targets among WRs in 2022, Fields struggled mightily in that category finishing 28th in adjusted deep completion percentage. Last year, Bears WRs averaged 18 total fantasy points per game… as a unit. In Fields starts, Bears WRs totaled just two weeks (Dante Pettis in Week 6 &amp; Darnell Mooney in Week 9) of over 12 fantasy points! People are expecting more from D.J. likening this to A.J. Brown and Jalen Hurts’ connection in Philadelphia. We caution managers to slow down and accept what he is: a good, not great fantasy WR.</p>

It says he’s playing this year at age 30 but it feels like he’s aged even further in our minds. He hasn’t been a top 12 WR since 2016, nor caught more than 56 % of his targets since 2018. It’s been a while folks especially after sitting out all of 2022 recovering from his ACL injury. The Ravens felt comfortable throwing $15 million his way but it’s hard penciling him in as anything more than the 3rd target in this offense. Mark Andrews is still the target dominator and a healthy Rashod Bateman with do-it-all 1st round rookie Zay Flowers should also eat a large part of the passing pie. Lamar Jackson and this new offense under Todd Monken could increase the passing volume immensely but we’re not betting on OBJ returning to even the top-36 WRs. Let someone else in your league scream with excitement that they got OBJ before you remind them he’s finished outside the top-24 weekly WRs almost 80 percent of the time since 2020.</p>

He was all the rage as a late round TE in 2022 and started the year off falling flat on his face. He was banished to the waiver wire only to resurrect from the fantasy grave as the TE4 from Week 8 on thanks to some multi-TD games. He became 1-of-6 TEs since 2000 to put up a line of 50/500/7 before turning 24 years old. The TDs are the most concerning thing with the arrival of D.J. Moore and Robert “TD” Tonyan in the mix. Kmet was basically the last man standing in 2022 after Darnell Mooney went down and the ghost of Chase Claypool apparently roaming the field. He enters a contract year and we think we’ve seen the best of Kmet thus far. Unless Justin Fields takes a massive step forward from his career 4.1% TD rate, Kmet feels like a low volume, low ceiling option.</p>

He’s a highlight machine and we love watching the passion he plays the game with. But, this is fantasy football folks and Kittle’s end of season run with Brock Purdy was likely a bit of an outlier when you consider his entire career. He had seven TDs over the final month compared to averaging four TDs per season the previous five years of his career. He’s as volatile as they get which can be fun when he’s on a roll but regression can hit you like a ton of bricks. If you’re looking for an every week safer play at TE, you can wait a couple more rounds to take someone at a lower opportunity cost.</p>
