The 49ers also surprisingly selected RB Tyrion Davis-Price in the 3rd round to add to any already nauseous backfield rotation. He comes with a lot of risk but the lead dog in the 49ers backfield can be a valuable commodity.

The Saints went 5-2 in his starts before going down to injury and he was a much more efficient passer with the highest TD rate (8.9%) and passer rating (102.8) of his career. He could be eased in during training camp recovery from ACL &amp; MCL surgeries but he's more than equipped in this offense. The Saints added 11th overall pick Chris Olave and signed Jarvis Landry to pair with Michael Thomas &amp; Alvin Kamara; in other words, this is a lightyears difference from the WRs they trotted out there in 2021. Take a shot on Jameis late and the Saints taking a step this year despite losing Sean Payton.</p>

However, when you survey the speed on the roster with Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, and Mike Gesicki along with adding a  budding offensive mind with new head coach Mike McDaniel, it's Tua easy to get excited about this team's prospects. Reports this off-season have focused on giving Tua more opportunities to throw deep while also bringing a San Francisco-style offense eastward. Luckily, you don't have to pay up on the Miami hype. Grab Tua at the end of your draft or stash as your QB2 in hopes there is lightning in a bottle at the beginning of the year.</p>

But the Jets had massive upgrades across the board including adding arguably the best WR (Garrett Wilson) and RB (Breece Hall) talents in the NFL Draft. His tools and rushing ability make him a tantalizing projection of what could be in Year 2. The decision-making and plethora of sacks taken need to be corrected but there is a reason the Jets took him No. 2 overall. He has some obstacles in front of him but there are routes to him becoming a viable fantasy QB this year.</p>

Well, it seems like the rest of the world is ready to move on after Seattle selected Kenneth Walker III in the 2nd round of the NFL Draft. Penny seems like one of the better depth RBs you can add to your team in fantasy drafts this year. Seattle and Pete Carroll want to establish the run every chance they get and they were effective in the second half of the year in doing so. Penny is still the lead back in our opinion after Seattle re-signed him to a one year $5.75 million deal this off-season. They easily could've moved on but his explosion down the stretch showed you that there is still some fantasy goodness left in the tank. If he's your RB3 or 4 on your team, you're cooking with gas.</p>

We know what he is at this point of his career: a 1st &amp; 2nd down runner who has stone hands that even his coaches shy away from. But we need to be reminded that Clyde Edwards-Helaire has failed to finish a season and backup Darrel Williams became a fantasy league winner down the stretch as the goal-line back for KC. Jones is an efficient back averaging 4.5 yards a tote in his career and during the Patrick Mahomes era, the KC RB group has averaged nearly 12 rushing TDs per year. If Rojo falls into the end zone 7-8 times this year, you shouldn't be surprised.</p>

Nevertheless, it is not and so Pierce finds himself in a plush spot for opportunity on one of the worst rosters in the NFL. The draft capital (107th overall) isn't anything special but he scored an impressive 13 rushing TDs his senior year at Florida and could find himself in a goal-line role with his 215 lbs frame. He's a double-digit round RB with a chance to become a starter for an NFL team which is a rare thing to find in fantasy.</p>

He's always been an elite pass-catcher but it seems the one-year poo stain known as Carson Wentz soiled the plans of the Indianapolis offense. Historically, Matt Ryan targets the RB position better than league average and it seems Jonathan Taylor might not repeat the same insane workload he had in the past. It's possible that Hines is this team's 2nd leading receiver behind Michael Pittman Jr. as there is a lack of established options behind him. Throughout his career, Hines is a notoriously fast starter to the season so whether you trade him or not he's a valuable bench/FLEX option, especially in full PPR leagues.</p>

The Saints clearly loved him enough to trade up in the 1st round to take him over other WRs (Jameson Williams, Treylon Burks) many speculated would be drafted higher. He has elite speed (4.39 40-time) matched with some of the best route-running precision in this year's rookie class. He's a big play waiting to happen in a Saints offense that was completely void of playmakers in 2021. It's not out of the question that he finishes this year as the top fantasy wideout among rookies with an opportunity to start from Day 1. His draft cost also allows you to wait and see for a player who can return FLEX value very soon.</p>

This guy is legit good, and the Broncos think so too. They signed Patrick this past fall to a 3-year extension, and he's got the clear path to being this team's WR3. While he'll most likely be behind Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy in targets, Patrick's the type of bench WR we love to take late in drafts. If anything should happen to either Sutton or Jeudy, Jones would be an every-week fantasy starter as one of Russell Wilson's primary pass-catchers in what projects to be a good offense.</p>

But he's been productive in the NFL whenever he's been given the opportunity and now the stink of the New York Jets is gone. He gets to play in arguably the NFL's best offense with Josh Allen where he should man the slot as he's set to replace Cole Beasley. Beasley quietly saw a 20% target share in 2020 and then a 19% target share a season ago. If Crowder gets similar volume in this high-flying passing attack, he's going to be a value in drafts.</p>

Green Bay didn't do much in free agency to add to their depth chart giving the 34th overall pick a chance to earn a significant role on this team out of the gate. Of course, he'll have to earn the trust of Aaron Rodgers first, but his path to playing time is clear making him an intriguing late round target in fantasy drafts.</p>

Tyler Conklin saw 87 targets in this offense a season ago as the team's TE1, but now he's in New York, leaving Irv to operate as Minnesota's TE1 and primary pass catcher at the position. As long as Jefferson and Thielen are healthy, Irv's path to a fantasy ceiling is blocked, but we like his chances of putting up back end TE1 numbers. If you're punting the position in fantasy drafts, Irv is a solid late round target.</p>

Still only 27 years old, the opportunity is there for him with Trevor Lawrence to step into a meaningful part of this offense begging for an identity. Jacksonville TEs saw 19 percent of the team's targets and for a five-week stretch in the middle of the season before getting injured, Dan Arnold saw 7.4 targets a game. We also get to consider the fact Engram is more of a slot receiver as any facade that he could block in the NFL was dropped long ago. He'll have streaming weeks and perhaps this change of scenery lights a fire under a player many (especially Mike) touted for years.</p>

The Saints went 5-2 in his starts before going down to injury and he was a much more efficient passer with the highest TD rate (8.9%) and passer rating (102.8) of his career. He could be eased in during training camp recovery from ACL &amp; MCL surgeries but he's more than equipped in this offense. The Saints added 11th overall pick Chris Olave and signed Jarvis Landry to pair with Michael Thomas &amp; Alvin Kamara; in other words, this is a lightyears difference from the WRs they trotted out there in 2021. Take a shot on Jameis late and the Saints taking a step this year despite losing Sean Payton.</p>

However, when you survey the speed on the roster with Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, and Mike Gesicki along with adding a  budding offensive mind with new head coach Mike McDaniel, it's Tua easy to get excited about this team's prospects. Reports this off-season have focused on giving Tua more opportunities to throw deep while also bringing a San Francisco-style offense eastward. Luckily, you don't have to pay up on the Miami hype. Grab Tua at the end of your draft or stash as your QB2 in hopes there is lightning in a bottle at the beginning of the year.</p>

But the Jets had massive upgrades across the board including adding arguably the best WR (Garrett Wilson) and RB (Breece Hall) talents in the NFL Draft. His tools and rushing ability make him a tantalizing projection of what could be in Year 2. The decision-making and plethora of sacks taken need to be corrected but there is a reason the Jets took him No. 2 overall. He has some obstacles in front of him but there are routes to him becoming a viable fantasy QB this year.</p>

Well, it seems like the rest of the world is ready to move on after Seattle selected Kenneth Walker III in the 2nd round of the NFL Draft. Penny seems like one of the better depth RBs you can add to your team in fantasy drafts this year. Seattle and Pete Carroll want to establish the run every chance they get and they were effective in the second half of the year in doing so. Penny is still the lead back in our opinion after Seattle re-signed him to a one year $5.75 million deal this off-season. They easily could've moved on but his explosion down the stretch showed you that there is still some fantasy goodness left in the tank. If he's your RB3 or 4 on your team, you're cooking with gas.</p>

We know what he is at this point of his career: a 1st &amp; 2nd down runner who has stone hands that even his coaches shy away from. But we need to be reminded that Clyde Edwards-Helaire has failed to finish a season and backup Darrel Williams became a fantasy league winner down the stretch as the goal-line back for KC. Jones is an efficient back averaging 4.5 yards a tote in his career and during the Patrick Mahomes era, the KC RB group has averaged nearly 12 rushing TDs per year. If Rojo falls into the end zone 7-8 times this year, you shouldn't be surprised.</p>

Nevertheless, it is not and so Pierce finds himself in a plush spot for opportunity on one of the worst rosters in the NFL. The draft capital (107th overall) isn't anything special but he scored an impressive 13 rushing TDs his senior year at Florida and could find himself in a goal-line role with his 215 lbs frame. He's a double-digit round RB with a chance to become a starter for an NFL team which is a rare thing to find in fantasy.</p>

He's always been an elite pass-catcher but it seems the one-year poo stain known as Carson Wentz soiled the plans of the Indianapolis offense. Historically, Matt Ryan targets the RB position better than league average and it seems Jonathan Taylor might not repeat the same insane workload he had in the past. It's possible that Hines is this team's 2nd leading receiver behind Michael Pittman Jr. as there is a lack of established options behind him. Throughout his career, Hines is a notoriously fast starter to the season so whether you trade him or not he's a valuable bench/FLEX option, especially in full PPR leagues.</p>

The Saints clearly loved him enough to trade up in the 1st round to take him over other WRs (Jameson Williams, Treylon Burks) many speculated would be drafted higher. He has elite speed (4.39 40-time) matched with some of the best route-running precision in this year's rookie class. He's a big play waiting to happen in a Saints offense that was completely void of playmakers in 2021. It's not out of the question that he finishes this year as the top fantasy wideout among rookies with an opportunity to start from Day 1. His draft cost also allows you to wait and see for a player who can return FLEX value very soon.</p>

This guy is legit good, and the Broncos think so too. They signed Patrick this past fall to a 3-year extension, and he's got the clear path to being this team's WR3. While he'll most likely be behind Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy in targets, Patrick's the type of bench WR we love to take late in drafts. If anything should happen to either Sutton or Jeudy, Jones would be an every-week fantasy starter as one of Russell Wilson's primary pass-catchers in what projects to be a good offense.</p>

But he's been productive in the NFL whenever he's been given the opportunity and now the stink of the New York Jets is gone. He gets to play in arguably the NFL's best offense with Josh Allen where he should man the slot as he's set to replace Cole Beasley. Beasley quietly saw a 20% target share in 2020 and then a 19% target share a season ago. If Crowder gets similar volume in this high-flying passing attack, he's going to be a value in drafts.</p>

Green Bay didn't do much in free agency to add to their depth chart giving the 34th overall pick a chance to earn a significant role on this team out of the gate. Of course, he'll have to earn the trust of Aaron Rodgers first, but his path to playing time is clear making him an intriguing late round target in fantasy drafts.</p>

Tyler Conklin saw 87 targets in this offense a season ago as the team's TE1, but now he's in New York, leaving Irv to operate as Minnesota's TE1 and primary pass catcher at the position. As long as Jefferson and Thielen are healthy, Irv's path to a fantasy ceiling is blocked, but we like his chances of putting up back end TE1 numbers. If you're punting the position in fantasy drafts, Irv is a solid late round target.</p>

Still only 27 years old, the opportunity is there for him with Trevor Lawrence to step into a meaningful part of this offense begging for an identity. Jacksonville TEs saw 19 percent of the team's targets and for a five-week stretch in the middle of the season before getting injured, Dan Arnold saw 7.4 targets a game. We also get to consider the fact Engram is more of a slot receiver as any facade that he could block in the NFL was dropped long ago. He'll have streaming weeks and perhaps this change of scenery lights a fire under a player many (especially Mike) touted for years.</p>
