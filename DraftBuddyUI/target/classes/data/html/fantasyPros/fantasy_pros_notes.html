This would have placed him as the RB3 in weekly fantasy scoring behind only Jonathan Taylor and Derrick Henry.                                                </div>

Taylor also led the NFL in red-zone touches (92), which was not that surprising considering he ranked fifth in that category as a rookie.<br />
<br />
That elite goal-line usage helped separate Taylor from the pack as the bonafide No. 1 running back in fantasy football. No player came close to sniffing his amount of volume near paydirt. Taylor's 42 carries inside the 10-yard line were 12 more than the next-closest back (Damien Harris, 30).<br />
<br />
Pairing Taylor's elite red-zone usage with his ascending role as a receiver - 11th in routes run and sixth in route participation in 2021 - makes him worthy of the 1.01 pick across all fantasy formats. No quarterback targeted running backs more than new Colts quarterback Matt Ryan did in 2021 - 8.6 targets per game.                                                </div>

At 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds, Ekeler finished 8th in the NFL in total touches (276) and 14th in touches per game (17.2).<br />
<br />
But the raw touches hardly showcase the fantasy value Ekeler possesses, because he often commands an extremely high-share of high-value targets ie. targets and red-zone opportunities.<br />
<br />
His 13.9% target share and 70 receptions ranked second behind only Najee Harris. Ekeler's 18 red-zone touchdowns and 63 red-zone touches ranked first and second respectively. <br />
<br />
With such a secure role as a receiver out of the backfield and as a featured red-zone weapon in a high-powered offense, it's hard to imagine a healthy Ekeler not returning at least top-5 fantasy status in 2022. He wrapped a bow on the 2021 season as the RB3 in points per game and RB2 overall in half-point scoring.                                                </div>

The Steelers rookie running back managed a league-leading 381 touches in 2021, and finished as the RB4 in half-point scoring as a result. <br />
<br />
The volume he is going to see in 2022 will ensure he is one of the safest running backs available in fantasy football.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still, the issue with Harris pertains to his true upside potential in an potentially capped offense led by a rookie quarterback. An immobile Ben Roethlisberger was a check-down target machine to Harris in 2021 which may not be the case in 2022. <br />
<br />
And despite all of his total raw touches, Harris only saw 37 touches (22nd) in the red zone and scored six red-zone touchdowns.                                                </div>

The Tennessee Titans running back led the position in fantasy PPR points per game (23.4) through eight weeks and bested his 2020 2,000-yard campaign by more than 2.5 PPR points per game.<br />
<br />
The unicorn running back averaged 29.6 touches per game - seven more than the next closest running back before his injury. And although he didn't play again until the postseason, Henry still finished 15th in the NFL in total touches and as the RB20 overall in just eight games played.<br />
<br />
No running back better depicts the "volume is king" mantra better than the King himself and his guaranteed volume make him near bulletproof. <br />
<br />
Coming off an injury-plagued season does raise some concerns about whether Henry's body is going to break down because of his insane workload. And the lack of pass-game usage is a detriment to his value in PPR formats. But it's impossible to ignore his workload opportunity in 2022 within a Titans anemic passing offense. They don't have any reason to not feature him and there are no indications that they are going to stop with him due $15M this season. <br />
<br />
Seems more likely than not they ride Henry did his contract expires before the 2024 season when he hits age 30.                                                </div>

The Bengals running back finished the season third in total touches (334) and sixth in touches per game (20.9). <br />
<br />
Mixon also ranked third in goal-line carries (16) and tied Jonathan Taylor/James Conner in red-zone touchdowns. 2021 was the perfect storm for the fantasy RB3 in half-points scoring coming off a truncated 2020 campaign, and there's reason to believe the positive production will continue in 2022.<br />
<br />
The Bengals offensive line has been revamped entirely, ensuring that Mixon will be able to repeat his top-10 PFF rushing grade from a season ago. He also flashed upside a receiver down the playoff stretch for the Bengals, averaging nearly six targets per game while running a route on 57% of offensive dropbacks through six games. That route participation would have ranked third among all running backs during the regular season. <br />
<br />
Mixon fits all the criteria that a fantasy manager would want as a mid-range first round selection in fantasy football. However, he owns the RB7 ADP at 12th overall in early best ball drafts.                                                </div>

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end posted his worst points per game average (16.6) dating back to 2017 while also posting a career-low in yards per route run (1.84) and PFF grade (81.8).<br />
<br />
It seems logical that Kelce's reign as the perennial consensus TE1 has come to a conclusion as he enters his age-33 season in 2022.<br />
<br />
However, it's impossible to ignore the high-end target share that Kelce will command in the Chiefs offense after they traded Tyreek Hill. His 20% target share ranked second-best at the position in 2021. Although it was a slight fall-off from his 23% average target share from 2019 and 2020.                                                </div>

His 29% target share fell to 24% as did his yards per route run (2.5 versus 1.8). This resulted in Diggs finishing with just two games with at least 90 receiving yards, a dramatic decrease from his ten 90-plus yard outings during the 2020 regular season. <br />
<br />
He finished as a top-15 WR just once through the first nine weeks of the season but improved down the stretch as Buffalo's offense hit its stride. He had three top-10 finishes as the WR8 in fantasy points per game in half-point scoring (14.8). <br />
<br />
Still, top-5 upside still exists with Diggs in this explosive Bills offense even if his target share holds at 24% in 2022. Because his command of high-value targets in the Buffalo offense was unmatched by almost every other WR in the NFL. <br />
<br />
He was one of just two WRs to hit over 2,000 air yards (Justin Jefferson). Diggs also commanded the most end-zone targets in the NFL (25) during the regular season - six more than the next closest receiver (Justin Jefferson).                                                </div>

Adams' high level of play won't stop in Las Vegas, but his fantasy stock does get slightly dented going from Rodgers to Derek Carr. It's unlikely that Carr hyper-targets Adams to the length of a 28% target share as Rodgers has done for so many seasons. Incumbent Raiders pass-catchers Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow represent more target competition than Adams has ever played with since becoming the alpha in Green Bay.                                                </div>

The Baltimore Ravens fourth-year TE led the position with a 25% target share, 28% air yards share and 17.5 fantasy points per game. He ran a route on 84% of offensive dropbacks, which also ranked first.<br />
<br />
With Marquise Brown traded to the Cardinals, Andrews has solidified himself as clear TE1 with a still unproven second-year wideout as his main competition for targets.<br />
<br />
However, be aware that even if Andrews does repeat his efforts as TE1 it may not be to the extent that it was in 2021. His 623 routes run were 209 more than he had in 2020 and fueled the career-year. Andrews' increase in route running was tied to the Ravens boosted pass-play rate (56%). <br />
<br />
From 2019-2020, Baltimore passed on fewer than 46% of their plays. Because Baltimore's increase in passing was due out of necessity in 2021, I'd project it to regress closer to the 2019-2020 rate for this upcoming season.                                                </div>

<br />
It's worth noting that Hill posted a career-low in yards after the catch per reception (4.3, 42nd) and yards per route run (2.14, 11th). Hill's aDOT also dipped dramatically to 10.6, which was the lowest it's been since his rookie season.<br />
<br />
And It's undeniable that going from Patrick Mahomes to Tua Tagovailoa is a massive downgrade for Hill. Tagovailoa has yet to show that he can properly fuel a fantasy WR1, so it's hard to expect Hill to deliver a top-5 season with a lesser passer. Especially with Tagovailoa's lack of a confident deep ball, a prominent running game, and Jaylen Waddle also heavily involved in the offensive game plan. Sure, Hill will have his weeks when he is peppered with low-value targets in PPR formats, but the massive downfield touchdowns will happen much less frequently.                                                </div>

<br />
The Chargers slot receiver remained Justin Herbert's go-to option as his 17th-ranked 22% target share led the Chargers.<br />
<br />
But it's worth noting that Mike Williams out-scored Allen in half-point scoring in the season's totality, and that Allen posted his lowest yards per route run (1.78) since 2014.                                                </div>

He averaged an insane 10.1 targets, 6.1 receptions, and 110.3 receiving yards per game, so "wide back" or no "wide back" matters very little.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Running back Melvin Gordon signed a one-year deal with the Denver Broncos, ultimately halting the Javonte Williams 2022 breakout season. The idea of Williams playing a three-down role was salivating, but Gordon's return should not be overlooked after a seriously underrated 2021 campaign.<br />
<br />
MG3's return definitely hurts Williams' top-tier fantasy ceiling. He's going to split work with another capable back in Gordon which is exactly what new head coach Nathaniel Hackett desires and spoke on at the NFL owners meeting in March.<br />
<br />
However, keep in mind that Williams finished 13th in touches last season (246, 14.6 per game) and would be the favorite to take another step forward in the passing game - Aaron Jones-esque - after finishing as one of two rookie RBs inside the top-15 in route participation in 2021: Najee Harris (first) and Javonte Williams (13th).<br />
<br />
Williams falls just out of the fantasy RB1 conversation for me in redraft and best ball, but he's right on the cusp. I don't think he can be ranked worse than RB15 considering that's where he finished as a rookie amid a split workload in a much worse offensive environment.                                                </div>

He also finished the season tied for the league's eighth-highest target share (24%), which was 11 percentage points higher than the next closest Colt, Zach Pascal, at 13%.<br />
<br />
He also made 18 highlight-reel contested catches - fourth most in the NFL. And his 31% target share from Weeks 13-18 cemented his place in Indy's WR1 chair heading into 2022. <br />
<br />
With Matt Ryan under center Pittman has the volume potential to be a top-12 fantasy option. Ryan has a history of fueling top-end fantasy WRs like Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley, making a top-five finish not all that crazy for Big Mike in 2022.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that last season, Ridley as the Falcons' No. 1 receiver owned the sixth-highest target rate per route run and ranked second among all wide receivers in expected fantasy points per game (16.5).                                                </div>

While a passing game role is a wish that will likely never come true (1.8 targets per game, 2021), Chubb doesn't need it to remain a locked-in top 12-15 fantasy back. His prowess on early downs makes up for the lack of targets. Last year he ranked third in evaded tackles, sixth in breakaway run rate, and fourth in yards per touch last season. As soon as Deshaun Watson is under center, Chubb should see a bump in scoring opportunities. Last season Cleveland ranked 23rd in red-zone scoring attempts per game.                                                </div>

Brown is one of the most talented wide receivers in the NFL, and talent plays regardless of area code or jersey. Brown was the fourth-highest graded wide receiver per PFF last season and fifth in yards per route run (minimum 50 targets). Before switching to a run-first approach, the Eagles were sixth in neutral passing rate (Weeks 1-6) last season. We could see Philly go back to this pass-heavy offensive approach to see if Jalen Hurts truly is the guy. This means the target volume for Brown could surpass expectations.                                                </div>

Elliott has amassed 1,938 touches (22 per game) over his six-year career, never handling less than 268 touches in any season. Elliott should be viewed as an RB2 in many formats that could slowly dissolve into a high-end RB3 if Tony Pollard gets more run in 2022.                                                </div>

Pitts ranked third in receiving yards and eighth in receptions among all tight ends. In deeper metrics, he was elite, ranking fourth in targets per snap and yards per route run (minimum 50 targets, per PFF). Since 2018 the only rookie tight end to finish their inaugural season with a higher yards per route run has been Albert Okwuegbunam (minimum 15 targets, per PFF). Pitts finished as the TE11 in fantasy points per game as the eyesore of only one receiving touchdown drug down his fantasy value. Pitts has TE1 overall upside if the touchdowns bounce back in a big way in 2022.                                                </div>

<br />
The best-case scenario for the Steelers' No. 1 wide receiver is seeing a boatload of targets - albeit inefficient like last season when he ranked second in that category - to deliver for fantasy.<br />
<br />
Whether it's Trubisky or the rookie under center, that is the reality with DJ. Let's not forget that last year's heavily-coveted rookie quarterback class produced almost zero reliable options outside of Brandin Cooks (WR20), Jakobi Meyers (WR33) and Kendrick Bourne (WR30).<br />
<br />
So with a top-15 early best ball ADP in an offense with more competition for targets between Chase Claypool, Pat Freiermuth, George Pickens and Calvin Austin III, I would need Johnson to fall significantly in drafts before selecting him.                                                </div>

Allen led the quarterback position averaging 24.6 fantasy points per game and a whopping 26.7 expected fantasy points - nearly three points more than the next closest signal-caller. The Bills quarterback's dual-threat ability - third in rushing yards (763) and rushing attempts (122) - provides him a fantasy ceiling that only a few other quarterbacks can match. No quarterback had more top-3 finishes or top-8 weekly finishes than Allen did a season ago<br />
<br />
That's why he's deserving of being the first quarterback drafted across all formats.<br />
<br />
Because even after taking a slight step back as a passer in 2021 - 104.9 passer rating vs. 97.9 passer rating - a higher passing touchdown ceiling exists for Allen in 2022. His 5.6% TD rate was worse than in 2020 and ranked just ninth in 2021. Case in point: despite finishing No. 1 overall, Allen ended with the 5th-most fantasy points under expectation.                                                </div>

The Jets selected the Iowa State product at the top of Round 2, signifying his status as the team's locked-in RB1 for the foreseeable future. Hall's three-down skill set suggests he never has to come off the field, and the sheer volume he garners will vault him into redraft top-20 running back territory. <br />
<br />
The Iowa State product totaled over 4,500 yards from scrimmage, 50 touchdowns and 80 catches over three seasons in the college ranks.<br />
<br />
A workload of approximately 240 touches - based on ESPN fantasy analyst Mike Clay's projections and how many touches the cumulative Jets RB1 earned last season -  would place Hall inside the top-15 considering every running back last season that hit that threshold finished inside that ranking.<br />
<br />
2021 fourth-rounder Michael Carter had his moments as a rookie, but the Jets know he's just a No. 2 running back. Anticipate Hall to shoulder 15-20 touches per game based on the workload that Carter received last season when Tevin Coleman missed time.<br />
<br />
From Weeks 7-9 with Coleman sidelined, Carter averaged 19 touches per game and a 66% snap share. Upon Coleman's return from injury in Week 10, Carter averaged 14 touches per game and a 55% snap share in the games they played together.                                                </div>

Along with breaking Anquan Boldin's rookie reception record, Waddle commanded a 22% target share and 24% target rate per route run - 18th-best in the NFL.<br />
<br />
But with the expensive addition of veteran Tyreek Hill, it is less likely that Waddle is the clear-cut No. 1 receiver in Miami. Hill is coming off a season where he commanded the league's seventh-highest target rate per route run (27%). The trade moves Waddle down from a fringe WR1 to mid-range fantasy WR2 after seeing almost zero target competition last season.                                                </div>

The Bears' receiving weapons are depleted outside of Darnell Mooney and Cole Kmet, so there's an easy pathway for plenty of check downs weekly. With Fields under center, he saw 4.75 targets per game, which would be a new career-high if that repeats this upcoming season. The problem for Montgomery is the new regime has no previous ties to him. He's seen an 80-90% opportunity share over the last two seasons, which has helped fuel his fantasy stock. Still, new offensive coordinator Luke Getsy comes from a system in Green Bay that hasn't pushed Aaron Jones over the 60% opportunity share mark since 2020. It's conceivable Montgomery will lose snaps on early downs to Khalil Herbert or Darrynton Evans and routes to Trestan Ebner. If that comes to fruition, he's better viewed as a high-end RB3 with low-end RB2 upside.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Travis Etienne Jr. was a standout college football running back for the Clemson Tigers from 2017 to 2020 and was selected by the Jaguars in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft -25th overall. However, his rookie season was cut short by a preseason Lisfranc injury. Some NFL personnel reported that Etienne could have come back towards the end of the year had the Jaguars been in playoff contention instead of being the league's laughing stock.<br />
<br />
Etienne is expected to be fully cleared by training camp, giving him a leg up on the RB1 role as the Jacksonville Jaguars install a new offense under new head coach Doug Pederson. With James Robinson attempting to come back from a torn Achilles injury suffered on December 26th, Etienne figures to be the featured back during this spring/summer.<br />
<br />
Do not forget what this guy did at Clemson with Trevor Lawrence (QB - JAC) as his quarterback. During his final season as a Clemson Tiger, he led the country in receiving yards and ranked second in receptions among running backs. Etienne also racked up the most rushing attempts of 20-plus yards (40) from 2018 to 2019 while only carrying the ball 20-plus times once since 2018.                                                </div>

He saw snap shares from 39% to as high as 81%. While he racked up volume in the process with 18.7 touches per game, his efficiency numbers were middling at best. His 2.31 yards after contact per attempt was a far cry from the 2.96 he rattled off in his rookie season (per PFF). With a full offseason to hopefully recoup any lost juice and return to his first-year form, Akers has the upside to be a workhorse in one of the best offenses in the NFL.                                                </div>

Since 2019 he's suffered catchable target rates that have ranked 70th, 77th, and 41st in the NFL. Carson Wentz might not be amazing, but if he continues the deep ball prowess that he flashed last season, McLaurin could offer fantasy managers high-end WR2 production. In 2021 Wentz was fourth in deep-ball accuracy, which pairs well with McLaurin, who was second in deep-ball targets last year.                                                </div>

The Los Angeles Chargers signal-caller is a certified stud - a top-five, elite-tier fantasy quarterback in 2022. Only Tom Brady and Josh Allen posted as many top-5 weeks as Herbert did last season. He and Brady led the NFL with nine 300-yard passing games. Since entering the NFL in 2020, Herbert has thrown for 300-plus yards in 53% of his games played. <br />

Hard to argue with the choice to sign a three-year deal worth $60M attached to a young superstar quarterback, especially when that quarterback fueled a career-year. <br />
<br />
He stormed out the gate in 2021 as the WR2 in fantasy through the first five weeks of the season, averaging 94.2 receiving yards and 1.2 receiving touchdowns per game.<br />
<br />
Big Mike finished the season as the WR23 in fantasy points per game despite cooling off considerably in the later weeks in addition to leaving a boatload of touchdown production on the table.<br />
<br />
He finished sixth in end-zone targets (16) but caught only five for touchdowns.<br />
<br />
With positive TD regression on his side, Williams looks like a sneaky candidate to repeat his WR12 overall finish in the half-point scoring format.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Entering Year 3, it looked like Courtland Sutton was on the cusp of true elite fantasy WR1 production, but his 2020 season was lost due to a torn ACL in Week 2. It was unclear how productive Sutton would be returning from the devastating knee injury.<br />
<br />
But to start the 2021 season, the Broncos wide receiver looked like his old self. He averaged 13.8 fantasy points per game (17th) and had a 27% target share in Weeks 2-7 during the regular season. <br />
<br />
It wasn't until Jerry Jeudy's return from injury that Sutton - and the rest of the Broncos pass catchers - became obsolete in a crowded, run-heavy offense led by a combination of Lock/Teddy Bridgewater. Nevertheless, Sutton finished the season as the fantasy WR46. <br />
<br />
However, even in the anemic offense, Sutton still finished seventh in air yards (1,756), cemented in between Tyler Lockett and D.K. Metcalf, in 2021.<br />
<br />
Sutton has a real chance to recapture his elite form another year removed from his ACL injury. It also helps substantially that he has received an ultra upgrade at the quarterback position with Denver's trade for Russell Wilson. <br />
<br />
Wilson has always been an elite downfield passer - he had the sixth-highest passer rating on throws of 20-plus air yards last season - which plays heavily into Sutton's strengths as a vertical threat.                                                </div>

The former MVP ranked fourth in fantasy points per game (22.0) tying Justin Herbert with 12 weekly top-12 QB finishes. Still, Mahomes averaged fewer fantasy points per game than in 2020 (25.2). <br />
<br />
Additionally, the loss of Tyreek Hill cannot be ignored heading into 2022. The duo ranks second in combined passing touchdowns (41) since 2016 - despite Mahomes not becoming the starter until the 2018. Mahomes can't totally be written off as a top-five fantasy option - .QB4 without Hill through the first five weeks of 2019 averaging 25 fantasy points per game - but there's real concern about his top-tier weekly ceiling without Hill.<br />
<br />
Especially coming off a season where he posted a career-low PFF passing grade (77.5) and career-high in interceptions (16). He's likely being overvalued as the QB2 in early best ball drafts on name recognition alone.                                                </div>

We already know the pass game usage is capped with J.D. McKissic resigned, but now the goalline could be in jeopardy with Brian Robinson on the depth chart. The team has talked about lightening Gibson's load, so the threat of Robinson is real, especially if Gibson keeps putting the ball on the turf. Since 2020 he's tied with Ezekiel Elliott for the most fumbles (six) in the NFL among running backs.                                                </div>

Dobbins performed in fantasy football from Weeks 11-17 in full PPR (RB11) during the 2020 season, guess who outscored him... J.D. McKissic. That's because McKissic caught 37 passes versus Dobbins' three.<br />
<br />
Guys like Derrick Henry can overcome the lack of receiving work because they are entrenched bell cows, but that's not the case with Dobbins in Baltimore with Gus Edwards also in the mix. Dobbins only slightly out-touched Edwards 86-74 down the stretch in 2020.<br />
<br />
It would be pure ignorance to assume that Dobbins will take over the backfield considering Edwards has been excellent with every opportunity he has received.<br />
<br />
Dobbins also ran extremely hot when it came to scoring touchdowns, scoring at least one TD in every game from Week 11 on. His nine total rushing TDs ranked 12th in the league and nearly doubled his expected output (5.5, 30th) - the sixth-highest difference at the position.<br />
<br />
Drafters have to understand that to invest in Dobbins as a late third-rounder or fourth-rounder (RB20, 50th overall ADP) he needs to run hot in the TD category coming off the season-ending ACL injury. They also should expect zero-to-little pass-game work with Jackson's tendency to not check down along with the additions of receiving backs, veteran Mike Davis and rookie Tyler Badie.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Lamar Jackson had a season to forget in 2021, as he dealt with a plethora of injuries/illnesses and regressed immensely as a passer. Two key metrics at PFF that are important to analyze for QBs are performance in a clean pocket and throwing at the intermediate level.<br />
<br />
Jackson ranked 28th in passer rating from a clean pocket (90.4) and 22nd in PFF passing grade at the intermediate level (70.0). Despite all his shortcomings as a passer, Jackson still finished the season second in expected fantasy points per game (23.8) and seventh in fantasy points per game (21.3).<br />
<br />
His expected fantasy point per game output marked the highest of his career thanks to the Ravens' willingness to throw more in 2021. From 2019-2020, Jackson had 37 or more passing attempts in a game only four times. He did so five times in 2021, with Baltimore throwing at a 60% clip. <br />
<br />
However, I would not anticipate the pass-heavy approach to continue into 2022. Their philosophical change on offense was forced out of necessity based on the injuries. But a lack of passing doesn't impact Jackson they way it does most other QBs with his greatest fantasy asset being his legs.  <br />
<br />
Jackson may never recapture his 2019 rare MVP form when he averaged north of 28 fantasy points per game, but a 22-point per game average seems like his norm based on his last two years of fantasy production. In 2020, he led all QBs in fantasy points per dropback. That cements him as a clear-cut top-5 fantasy QB.                                                </div>

In his final season in the Windy City, Robinson's yards per route dipped to a career-low of 1.13, which ranked 79th out of 90 qualifying wide receivers with 50 or more targets. Even pigeonholing Robinson in the Odell Beckham role from last season isn't as lucrative as it seems. In Weeks 12-18 last year, Beckham saw an 18.7% target share which would have ranked 44th among wide receivers. He also averaged 12.0 fantasy points per game which placed him as the WR31 in weekly fantasy production among wide receivers that started three or more games in that span. If his efficiency bounces back to previous levels, Robinson is a WR3 with WR2 upside.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">The Raiders offense looks to reach new heights in 2022 with No. 1 wide receiver Davante Adams added to the fold. And that greatly benefits the team's lead ball-carrier Josh Jacobs. A more efficient offense lends itself to more scoring opportunities, and Jacobs will reap the most rewards as the team's primary red-zone back.<br />
<br />
Last year's RB13 smashed career highs in all receiving categories in 2021 despite playing alongside Kenyan Drake and Jalen Richard. Injuries to the back-ups boosted Jacobs' role as a receiver slightly, but it was not the only cause.<br />
<br />
There was a deliberate effort to feature Jacobs more as a receiver with him catching at least two passes in 12 of his 15 games played. And more importantly, the receiving capability that Jacobs displayed puts to rest the narrative that he is "game-script" dependent. Whether the Raiders are winning or losing in a loaded 2022 AFC West, JJ has proven he can be used in all facets.<br />
<br />
Now the Raiders did elect to sign both Brandon Bolden and Ameer Abdullah this offseason to bolster their running back stable behind Jacobs. Bolden has been a special teams guy nearly his entire career, so I doubt he carves out any legitimate role on offense. <br />
<br />
Abdullah has been used as a third-down back on the several teams he has been on at the NFL level, but I am not ready to declare him as a huge threat to Jacobs' workload. Sure he might work in some, but not enough to hurt Jacobs' bottom-line value. The team also drafted Zamir White in the fourth round, but I would not expect much from White in year one based on Josh McDaniels' track record from New England of not featuring Day 3 rookie RBs. <br />
<br />
The new head coach is more likely to run Jacobs into the ground on an expiring contract as he did with Dion Lewis, LeGarrette Blount and Shane Vereen during his Patriots tenure.<br />
<br />
And besides, the red-zone role is the most significant for fantasy points, and that looks to be clearly in Jacobs' grasp.<br />
<br />
Two-down back Damien Harris was in the red-zone role for the Patriots last season and flourished because of it. He ranked fourth in carries (46) and third in rushing TDs (13) from inside the 20-yard line.                                                </div>

Hockenson and Logan Thomas failed to live up to their lofty projections (due to injury or not).<br />
<br />
But the process was still sound behind adding some of those players in the early rounds if you look at their per-game production. Speaking to Waller, the Raiders tight end came in third in expected fantasy points per game (14.6), which ranked top-20 among all tight ends and wide receivers. He also ranked sixth in points per game (12.1) and second in targets per game (8.5)<br />
<br />
The major concern with Waller in 2022 is how much Davante Adams will eat into his targets. However, I'd focus more on valuing Waller based on how good the Raiders offense as a whole can be with the addition of Adams. I'd be willing to forego one or fewer targets per game for Waller, if it means more scoring opportunities.<br />
<br />
The big-bodied Black Hole tight end is primed for positive touchdown regression after converting just two of his 10 end-zone targets into touchdowns in 2021.                                                </div>

It's still possible that the 49ers roll it back in 2022 with him as the primary rusher, though, as long as he doesn't face plant in camp.                                                </div>

He should have no issues leading the team in targets until Hopkins returns, with A.J. Green, Rondale Moore, and Zach Ertz being his main competition. While his volume will take a hit when Hopkins returns, he can still manufacture ceiling weeks late into the season with his role as a field stretcher. Last season he finished eighth in deep targets. He'll enjoy the deep ball upgrade he has received with Kyler Murray. Last year Murray was third in deep-ball accuracy rating (per Playerprofiler).                                                </div>

Last year his 1.72 yards per route run (40th, minimum 50 targets per PFF) won't blow you away, but the inherent volume he's walking into and Justin Fields taking another step forward will be the tide to help fantasy gamers raise "ships." Last season in the five games without Allen Robinson on the field, Mooney averaged 9.6 targets and 78.2 receiving yards per game. The yardage mark would have been the seventh-highest mark. Mooney's median is a low-end WR2 or high-end WR3, but if he garners more than 11 red-zone targets (38th) he received last year, he could vault even higher.                                                </div>

<br />
There is hope that he can provide a higher floor as the clear No. 1 wide receiver in Cleveland. And that floor will be accompanied by an extremely high ceiling with Deshaun Watson entrenched under center over the final 10 games of the season.<br />
<br />
The ex-Texans quarterback fueled top fantasy WR finishes for the likes of Brandin Cooks (WR16, 2020) and Will Fuller (WR8/game, 2020) the last time he played. And prior to that, he supplemented DeAndre Hopkins as the fantasy WR4 and WR10 from 2018-2019.<br />
<br />
However, the boom-or-bust nature to his game will likely remain a staple of his game. Having Brissett over the first six weeks - alongside a projectable run-heavy offense - will make Cooper inconsistent. <br />
<br />
Although Brissett can prove to be serviceable, he is a significant downgrade compared to Dak Prescott.<br />
<br />
If Cooper only managed to finish as WR27 in 15 games with Prescott, it's hard to be optimistic about him as the Browns WR1 or your fantasy WR2.<br />
<br />
There's also a glaring issue of the indoor/outdoor splits that Cooper has posted during his career.                                                </div>

With Michael Gallup questionable to begin the season at full health and only James Washington and Jalen Tolbert behind CeeDee Lamb, Schultz should easily carve out his role as the number two option in the Dallas passing attack.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Entering Year 3, Jerry Jeudy finally has a quarterback who can take full advantage of his ability to separate from defenders - 96th percentile separation percentage in 2021 - with Russell Wilson taking the reins.<br />
<br />
With Courtland Sutton and Tim Patrick operating from the outside, Jeudy figures to become Wilson's go-to target in the slot unless K.J. Hamler pushes him out. Jeudy's efficiency metrics should also see a massive boost now that he's catching passes from a future Hall-of-Fame quarterback, but it remains to be seen if Jeudy will play an ancillary role as a red-zone threat.<br />
<br />
Upgrading from Drew Lock and Teddy Bridgewater to Wilson is great for Jeudy, but we have to remember that he is still an unproven fantasy commodity. Great route-running and separation skills aside, he hasn't scored many fantasy points the last two seasons.<br />
<br />
And that's not the case with every Denver receiver, because Patrick's production last two seasons earned him a three-year, $34.5 million contract extension. <br />
<br />
Even so, Jeudy should easily experience his best NFL season to date in 2022, but it may not be as great as some die-hard Jeudy stans would care to admit. There are a lot of weapons in Denver, and predicting Wilson's best option on a week-to-week basis was often a challenge when it was only between DK Metcalf  and Tyler Lockett. <br />
<br />
As with those Seahawks receivers, there are going to be inconsistent weeks from Jeudy. And his lack of red-zone usage makes him more susceptible to bust games without having a touchdown opportunity to fall back on.                                                </div>

Thomas ranked 24th in yards per route run (minimum 50 targets per PFF) and drew a 27.9% target share in his seven games played. Thomas's health is still up in the air at the time of writing this, with reports that he's still not 100%. With a better supporting receiving class around him now, the Saints could throw the ball more often this season. If Thomas can get back to full strength, he should still be a fulcrum for the New Orleans aerial attack as a target hog.                                                </div>

After Week 9, with Hopkins banged up and in and out of the lineup, Murray was the QB16 with a 65.3% completion rate, 6.7 yards per attempt, and 251.8 passing yards per game. Fast forward to this season, and Hopkins is now slated to miss the first six games of the season. The trade to acquire Marquise Brown's services and drafting Trey McBride will help, but it's understandable to tread carefully with Kyler Murray exposure this season.                                                </div>

He set opposing defenses on fire as Tom Brady's underneath weapon, ranking eighth in YAC per reception and fifth in overall YAC yardage. The biggest question for Godwin in 2022 isn't talent but his recovery from an ACL and MCL tear sustained in Week 15 of last season. If Godwin is good to go, he's a top 15 fantasy wideout, but tempering expectations early on if he's limited or starts on the PUP pushes him into WR3 (or lower) territory based on possible time missed.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">This past year Chase Edmonds was viewed as the Arizona starting running back alongside James Conner. He stood as the RB21 through the first six weeks prior to suffering an ankle injury. Edmonds ranked fourth in the NFL in receptions among running backs (four catches and five targets per game).<br />
<br />
<br />
Edmonds won't ever be a true three-down back due to durability concerns, as he missed seven games this past season. But used properly and kept healthy, there's no denying Edmonds can be a viable fantasy option because of his receiving and explosiveness.<br />
<br />
His spot-start usage/production in Weeks 16-17 without James Conner in the lineup - 23.9 expected fantasy points per game - showcases a running back who can deliver massive fantasy upside any given week.<br />
<br />
In 14 career games when Edmonds has commanded at least 11 touches - his average fantasy finish is RB18 (PPR).<br />
<br />
Edmonds should see plenty of work in a Dolphins backfield splitting snaps with Sony Michel and Raheem Mostert. Considering Gaskins' fantasy spike weeks in 2021 all came from his receiving usage, Edmonds should find similar success in that role with Miami.<br />
<br />
The late signing of running back Mostert and Michel might have some fantasy gamers soured on Edmonds. However, Edmonds was never going to see a full bell-cow workload. Losing out on some early-down carries to Mostert or Michel was to be expected. I'd still prefer Edmonds in fantasy due to the pass-catching and hope the other signings keeps his ADP at a value.                                                </div>

<br />
Let's not forget JuJu had an elite sophomore campaign - 1,400-plus receiving yards - and he is still just 25 years old. With the most vacated targets available in Kansas City and Patrick Mahomes his new quarterback, 2022 will be a return to form for Smith-Schuster.<br />
<br />
He can operate from his natural position in the slot and benefit from the playmakers around him. After all, Smith-Schuster was at his best as a Pittsburgh Steeler during his first two seasons playing opposite of Antonio Brown.                                                </div>

Despite seeing 23 touches inside the 20, he failed to get into the endzone in 2021. While Sanders will see touchdown regression this season, he will still have to deal with Jalen Hurts near the goal line and the looming specters of Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell. He could return RB2 production this season, but there's the risk with his injury history and how high-value touches could be divided up in 2022.                                                </div>

His contract expires in 2023, and the Browns have a mighty stable of backs behind Nick Chubb including D'Ernest Johnson, Jerome Ford and Demetric Felton. <br />
<br />
If no deal is reached by the time the season starts, it would be much less likely that Hunt stays in Cleveland, making him a primed trade target for any team that suffers an injury at running back through training camp/preseason. .<br />
<br />
Last year Hunt was limited to just eight games due to a calf injury - but he maintained his effectiveness when healthy through the first six weeks of the season. He was a top-10 running back in PPR averaging 17 fantasy points per game averaging just south of 15 touches per game.<br />
<br />
Hunt's true upside will always be capped in a backfield as the Robin to Chubb's Batman. But should an injury occur to Chubb or another star running back, Hunt would easily flirt with league-winning upside if he is awarded the requisite volume to do so.<br />
<br />
His 6th-ranked yards after contact per attempt (3.54), 6th-ranked yards per route run (1.81) and 26% target rate suggest he's not slowing down entering age 27-season. All he needs his a change of scenery to recapture his rookie year accolades when he lead the NFL in rushing yards.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Although Clyde Edwards-Helaire's rookie season showed signs of hope - RB11 through his first six professional games - the step backward in Year 2 is cause for concern. <br />
<br />
CEH finished 59th out of 64 qualifying running backs in yards after contact per attempt (2.4) and third-to-last in target rate per route run at the running back position (13%). The poor rushing efficiency is bearable, but the poor receiving usage is hard to ignore. Especially considering his calling card out of LSU was catching balls out of the backfield.<br />
<br />
His 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs - also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and Jerick McKinnon (1.15). <br />
<br />
Some may also feel that the Ronald Jones addition is the final nail in the coffin for CEH, but it's not that black and white. Don't get me wrong though - Jones is a significant threat to earn more carries than Edwards-Helaire after the former first-rounder posted worse rushing efficiency numbers than his rookie season. But full transparency - Jones was not much better ranking 51st in the same category (2.5). <br />
<br />
It's actually a positive sign for Edwards-Helaire that the team brought in Jones instead of re-signing McKinnon or Williams. Those ex-Chiefs backs were proven pass-catchers and limited CEH's role as a receiver.<br />
<br />
I'd presume that Edwards-Helaire will fully take over the primary pass-catching role - which was the reason why the Chiefs drafted him in the 1st round in any way - while also working in tandem with Jones as a rusher on early downs. <br />
<br />
Jones splitting work might also help keep CEH healthy after his 10 missed games the past two seasons. <br />
<br />
The other RBs on the Chiefs current roster include Derrick Gore (4th-year UDFA), Isiah Pacheco (2022 7th-rounder), Jerrion Ealy (2022 UDFA) and Tayon Fleet-Davis (2022 UDFA).                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Damien Harris' ADP has dropped nearly a full round since the NFL draft took place and it's unwarranted. All the Patriots did was draft two Day 3 running backs who will most likely be red-shirted their first seasons. <br />
<br />
Harris should be the bellcow back for the Patriots in the final year of his contract as has been the case for many New England backs playing on expiring contracts. And should he see a heavy workload, there's going to be fantasy points to come by.<br />
<br />
In 2021, Harris finished 2nd in carries inside the 10-yd line, second to only Jonathan Taylor. The former Alabama back also led all running backs during the 2021 regular season in fantasy points per snap. <br />
<br />
As PFF's highest-graded running back (91.8) over the past two seasons, Harris needs to be held in extremely high regard. With one more year on his rookie deal, New England has all the incentive to ride Harris for the entire 2022 season.<br />
<br />
Although there is some risk that he will be used in a 50/50 split with second-year back Rhamondre Stevenson. Stevenson (93) and Harris (86) split touches nearly 50/50 in the team's remaining seven games. In the six games they played together, Stevenson slightly edged out Harris in expected fantasy points per game (9.3 vs 8.9).                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Joe Burrow finished the regular season as PFF's highest-graded passer (91.2) while also ranking first in super sticky stats like passing grade from a clean pocket (94.6) and passing grade throwing at the intermediate level (95.6). He finished the season as the QB8 averaging just north of 20.5 fantasy points per game. <br />
<br />
The Bengals quarterback has undoubtedly entered the conversation as one of the league's best real-life NFL passers, but might be slightly overvalued based on early best ball ADP with impending regression. He's the QB6 despite finishing as a top-6 fantasy quarterback just thrice in 2021.<br />
<br />
No quarterback scored more fantasy points over expectation, which hints that regression will hit Burrow in 2022. The LSU product also rushed for just 118 yards and two TDs. He rushed for fewer yards than Mac Jones, who is notorious for being ranked low across consensus due to his lack of upside as a rusher.<br />
<br />
However, there is a legitimate path for Burrow's upside to be further unlocked if the Bengals increase their pass rate as they did during his rookie season and down the playoff stretch. Burrow led the NFL in passing attempts per game (40.4) during his rookie season and averaged 38 passing attempts/23.0 fantasy points per game in his final six weeks <br />
<br />
An uptick in passing volume won't help Burrow's efficiency per se, but his fantasy numbers will be much more stable from week to week.<br />
<br />
Also can't forget to mention the Bengals revamped their offensive line as they look to not let their franchise quarterback get sacked 70 times - 22 more than the next closest quarterback.                                                </div>

Thielen has been top 23 in red-zone targets in four of the last five seasons, with three years on his resume with nine or more receiving touchdowns. With declining per route efficiency, he'll need the touchdowns (and many of them) to continue as a productive fantasy wide receiver.                                                </div>

The fourth-year back was unleashed down the stretch for the Bills, finishing as the RB3 in PPR scoring over the final six weeks of the season - 17 fantasy points per game. He gained the coaching staff's trust by earning 54-plus snaps to close out the season, the highest snap number Singletary saw all season dating back to Week 1.<br />
<br />
Buffalo also didn't let off the Motor Singletary when the team hit the playoffs, with the RB1 averaging nearly 20 fantasy points per game from the Wild Card Round through the Divisonal Round.<br />
<br />
With a proven track record and two years of bell-cow back usage in spurts, don't be surprised when PFF's fourth-ranked running back in rushes of 15-plus yards and seventh-ranked player in forced missed tackles in 2021 is the highly sought-after RB breakout that emerges from a high-octane ambiguous backfield.                                                </div>

After beginning the season in a hybrid role, the team moved him to more of a traditional running back role as the season rolled along. In Weeks 1-10, Patterson played running back on 56.2% of his snaps and outside or in the slot on 37.7% of his snaps. He was a running back for 69.9% of his snaps for the rest of the season, with only 29.5% of his playing time coming as a receiver. Patterson flourished in his swiss army knife role as the RB10 through the first ten weeks before fading as the RB31 over his final seven games. The receiving game is where Patterson needs to be utilized to hit a ceiling. Last year, he was incredibly effective, ranking behind only Christian McCaffrey in yards per route run (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). With age, role, and increased target competition factoring into his 2022 outlook, Patterson is best viewed as an RB3/RB4 with upside.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Russell Wilson's weapons/supporting cast overall are pretty even going from Seattle to Denver, but Nathaniel Hackett calling the shots is an upgrade over Pete Carroll. <br />
<br />
Hackett's obviously had success with Aaron Rodgers that has translated into fantasy, so a top-five fantasy quarterback outcome is firmly in play with Wilson in 2022. After all, Wilson's long track record of efficient fantasy play is undeniable - he has finished among the top-six fantasy QBs five times since 2014.<br />
<br />
I like his chances of making it seven in 2022. Because Wilson is still among the league's elite passers when healthy. Before the finger derailed his season, Russ led the NFL in yards per attempt (10.4), passer rating (133.6) and passer rating from a clean pocket (130.9) before Week 5. Wilson also finished the season on a high note, averaging over 24 fantasy points per game in his last three contests.<br />
<br />
All in all, 2021 was a typical season for Wilson: peaks and valleys. He averaged 23 fantasy points per game from Weeks 1-4 and Weeks 16-18. In his six games post-injury, Wilson averaged an abysmal 13 fantasy points per game. Buy the inevitable 2022 dip on the future Hall of Fame quarterback in a new situation.<br />
<br />
That combined with a plethora of weapons in Denver, makes it very plausible he sees similar immediate success that other quarterbacks like Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford have had since changing teams late into their careers.<br />
<br />
However a QB10 ADP might be too rich, as I think he belongs in the same tier as Kirk Cousins, Derek Carr, and Matthew Stafford. <br />
<br />
Currently, he's the only QB drafted inside the top-12 that failed to hit the fantasy QB1 mark at least 50% of the time in 2021.<br />
<br />
He also has the lowest top-6 hit rate (15%), lowest top-12 rate (46%), and second-highest bust rate among the top-12 ADP.<br />
<br />
Considering the only "upgrade" Wilson has moved from Denver to Seattle is more favorable coaching (not necessarily receiver personnel, especially with the underrated loss of Tim Patrick), he's likely going to be inconsistent and overvalued due to a lack of rushing juice.                                                </div>

Prescott's former rushing floor evaporated as he finished with the lowest rushing yardage total (146) for a full season of his career. Despite losing Amari Cooper this offseason, the Cowboy's passing attack should be fine as the team retained Michael Gallup and Dalton Schultz and added Jalen Tolbert and James Washington. Dallas led the NFL in neutral pace last season. With heightened play volume helping his passing numbers, Prescott should have no issues compensating for the lost rushing production as a locked-in top ten fantasy quarterback.                                                </div>

<br />
He was PFF's third-highest graded running back (84.2). Stevenson also ranked 13th in rushing yards and in yards per route run (1.41). For fantasy, the rookie running back was the RB25 in total points scored, eight spots behind his backfield teammate Harris. <br />
<br />
There's a high ceiling for Stevenson, especially if you ask former Patriots linebacker Rob Ninkovich. The ESPN analyst went as far as saying that Stevenson "...will be one of the better, if not one of the top three, running backs in the league based on what I saw with his strength, explosion and catch-and-run ability."                                                </div>

He surpassed fellow highly touted receivers Elijah Moore (1.75) and Jaylen Waddle (1.75) in this metric. With A.J. Brown in town, the Eagles could return to the pass-heavy ways from the beginning of 2021. If this happens, Smith's low-end WR3 status from last season could be the floor if he can increase his touchdown output. Smith was the WR37 last year in receiving yards per game.                                                </div>

The kid's a certified stud and doesn't get the respect he deserves. The Raiders slot receiver hung a WR13 overall finish last season due to a spectacular late-season surge. <br />
<br />
He went over 100 receiving yards in three straight games (Weeks 12-14) while maintaining a 25% target share. <br />
<br />
From Week 12 onward, his production generated a WR8 standing in half-point scoring. <br />
<br />
Renfrow made the most of the opportunities he got in 2021, and that won't change in 2022. Adding Davante Adams and Darren Waller will make targets for Renfrow harder to come by, but stay rest assured that the shifty wideout will perform if either guy is forced to miss time.                                                </div>

Arizona adding Marquise Brown and Trey McBride will muddy the target waters some, but Ertz's role in the offense and Hopkins' missing time should allow him to get off to a fast start and propel him to another TE1 season.                                                </div>

Last year he ranked ninth in yards per route run (minimum 50 targets, per PFF) and receiving yards per game. If Lockett can hold off father time one more season, he can return WR3 numbers with boom weeks still in the range of outcomes.                                                </div>

In those two games, Lance averaged 12 carries and 60 yards on the ground as the QB20 and QB10 in weekly scoring. Even with Garoppolo at the helm, the 49ers were sixth in EPA per play and second in yards per play. Lance's legs give him a top 12-15 fantasy quarterback floor with top-five upside should he light it up through the air.                                                </div>

Unsurprisingly, Kirk established career highs across the board in targets (112), receptions (83), and receiving yards (1,035) while filling the void left by an injured DeAndre Hopkins.<br />
<br />
Kirk commanded a 21% target share without Hopkins in the lineup and averaged 13.8 fantasy PPR points per game - a top-10 per-game average. In addition, he finished with the second most receiving yards from the slot among all wide receivers. <br />
<br />
Kirk should stay kicked iside with the Jaguars after they got little production from that position in 2021. Marvin Jones and Laviska Shenault ranked in the bottom 10 with 1.30 yards per route run from the slot. Kirk ranked 13th with 1.80 yards per route run from the slot. He is shaping up to be the new Amari Rodgers for Trevor Lawrence, operating from the inside.<br />
<br />
At worst, Kirk takes shape as a strong WR3 asset who can elevate to WR2 status quickly with an up-and-coming quarterback.                                                </div>

Over that same timespan, Lazard has ranked seventh, first, and 25th in yards per route in this area of the field (minimum 20 short-area targets, per PFF). If Lazard assumes the lead role, he'll be a massive value in all formats.                                                </div>

<br />
Still, entering his age 30-season fantasy managers should question whether Woods has the juice left to continue producing for fantasy. Often viewed as a safe fantasy WR2 during his time in L.A. - he was WR17 before his injury in 2021 - Woods might be subject to some poor game conditions in the Titans' run-heavy approach that could nuke his weekly fantasy appeal.<br />
<br />
He's got a chance to be the No. 1 receiver if rookie Treylon Burks fails to hit the ground running, but anything less will not be fruitful for the seasoned veteran. <br />
<br />
<br />
Over the past two seasons, production has not been kind to WRs over 30 years old. Only three receivers over 30 - Cole Beasley, Adam Thielen, and Marvin Jones Jr. - finished as top-40 fantasy options. If he stays healthy, Woods could easily beat his ADP. <br />
<br />
But I'm just not sure how high his fantasy ceiling is based on the situation.                                                </div>

Baby Gronk was the TE7 from that time forward, averaging 11.3 fantasy points per game seventh). He would go on to finish the year as the TE13 overall despite running a route on just 56% of dropbacks.<br />
<br />
When starting and healthy, Freiermuth ran a route on 67% of dropbacks - a rate that would have ranked 15th-highest at the position in 2021. That's the bare minimum usage fantasy drafters should expect to see from the Penn State product with Ebron gone in free agency.                                                </div>

The Jets drafted workhorse running back Breece Hall at the top of the 2nd round, but even considered trading up for him in Round 1 before selecting him 36th overall. The draft capital shows New York's commitment towards Hall being their clear-cut RB1 for 2022 and beyond, which makes Carter nothing more than a hand-cuff. It's a reminder to always sell high on Day 3 running backs that flash as rookies; they can be easily replaced and likely won't "survive" draft after draft without investment from their team.<br />
<br />
Carter's looking anywhere between five-to-eight touches per game with Hall entrenched as the bellcow, making the former UNC back near obsolete as anything other than a backup with some upside. <br />
<br />
From Weeks 7-9 with Tevin Coleman sidelined, Carter averaged 19 touches per game and a 66% snap share. He also finished 10th in yards after contact per attempt (3.4) and third in PFF's elusive rating.<br />
<br />
Carter's receiving ability also fueled four top-17 weekly finishes in 2021, three of which were inside the top-13 in games that featured quarterback checkdown king Mike White under center.                                                </div>

With Kevin O'Connell at the controls this season, the passing rate could continue to be healthy (LAR, seventh), but the neutral pace could decline (LAR, 16th). If this happens and Adam Thielen takes a step back entering his age 32 season, Cousins will be rendered as a mid QB2.                                                </div>

<br />
Claypool commanded a 27% air yards share on the season and led the team in the metric over the final four weeks. Better days should be ahead of the Notre Dame product if Pittsburgh can get better downfield quarterback play from Kenny Pickett/Mitchell Trubisky. <br />
<br />
Claypool is also due for positive touchdown regression after catching just one of his 12 end-zone targets last season. The 6-foot-5 monster is no stranger to hitting paydirt, after being one of eight wide receivers to score double-digit touchdowns as rookies since 1998. <br />
<br />
However, Claypool's range of outcomes is quite wide heading into his third season with 2022 second-round pick George Pickens, chomping at the bit to be the No. 2 on the offense behind Diontae Johnson.                                                </div>

He now has the luxury of throwing to a surplus of offensive weapons including arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL in his old college teammate. <br />
<br />
Let's not forget that when Carr had everybody available last season, the Raiders quarterback ranked second in the NFL in passing yards and 15th in fantasy points per game. However, his ceiling was limited due to his lack of mobility and weaponry; Carr did not finish better than a top-8 quarterback at any point in 2021. <br />
<br />
But Adams figures to provide Carr with a red-zone weapon like no other that will unlock his fantasy ceiling. He's the exact positive touchdown regression that should launch Carr's fantasy numbers. Carr's 3.7 TD rate in 2021 was below his career average (4.3). And his 23 total passing touchdowns were seven below expectation.<br />
<br />
Fully anticipate Carr throwing for 30-plus laser scores bare minimum with Adams at his disposal. Every quarterback last season that threw for at least 30 touchdowns finished inside the top-10 in 2021.                                                </div>

With his target share in limbo, Gage has gone from a WR2/WR3 candidate to a WR4 with possibly huge upside.                                                </div>

The former undrafted free agent has been the Patriots target leader for the past two seasons, with his most recent accomplishment finishing top-12 in target share (23%) in 2021.<br />

The high-end target share also aligned with Meyer's deployment in the Patriots passing attack, where Meyers was running a route on 92% of team dropbacks - the sixth-highest mark in the league.<br />
<br />
New England's No. 1 receiver just needs to cash-in on more touchdowns to unlock his fantasy ceiling. He has been extremely underused in that category; his 866 receiving yards resulting in two touchdowns were the lowest of any WR in 2021.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">James Robinson operated as the pseudo bellcow for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021 after Travis Etienne went down with a preseason injury. He posted inconsistent fantasy production as the RB24 overall and in points per game in 14 games amid horrible usage deployed by the 2021 Jags coaching staff. <br />
<br />
His touches varied from 21-to-2 depending on the week, so he was nearly impossible to project in fantasy. It's possible that 2022 presents a similar issue with Robinson as Etienne makes his professional debut. <br />
<br />
But JRob does deserve credit for maintaining efficient play whenever he got opportunities last season, finishing 11th in yards after contact per attempt (3.3) and 8th in red-zone touchdowns (8). <br />
<br />
His real hurdle for fantasy relevance besides fending off a 2022 first-round running back is attempting a speedy recovery from a torn Achilles suffered in late December. He was unable to participate in OTAs, while his backfield counterpart is full-go as the team installs the new-look Doug Pederson offense. The former undrafted free agent is not guaranteed to be ready for Week 1. Although he did avoid being placed on the PUP list, which is encouraging for his short-term availability. <br />
<br />
It's hard to envision Robinson being anything more than a speculative zero-RB target, with hopes that he can recapture 2020 form if given the volume. However, Pederson's track record of deploying a multitude of backs does make it seem like Robinson will be a 1B to Etienne's 1A, with his clearest path to fantasy relevance coming through goal-line opportunities.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">After enjoying a breakout sophomore campaign in 2020 that saw Garrett Wilson earn a 34% dominator rating - which considers the number of touchdowns and receiving yards a player commands within their offense - at 20 years old, the Ohio State product ran it back in impressive fashion in 2021.<br />
<br />
The Buckeye scored 12 receiving touchdowns, compiled over 1,000 receiving yards and generated the FBS' 12th-highest passer rating when targeted (141.7). <br />
<br />
He also proved to NFL teams that he was more than just a shifty slot receiver, averaging 3.00 yards per route run despite operating on the outside on 83% of his routes run, which nearly matched his same yards per route run average from 2020 when he spent most of his time inside. <br />
<br />
And although Wilson's 2021 24% dominator rating was less than his sophomore campaign, that's really due to Ohio State's talent in the wide receiver room. He was competing for targets with senior Chris Olave and sophomore standout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who led the nation in PFF receiving grade (91.7). <br />
<br />
Going beyond the box score reveals that Wilson is a versatile route runner who can align anywhere on the field and still win.<br />
<br />
He was selected by the New York Jets 10th overall and joins a somewhat crowded WR room. And nobody can be sure Zach Wilson can support one or multiple fantasy assets. There are definitely question marks.<br />
<br />
However, Wilson is worth betting on because he's shown the ability at Ohio State to command targets and produce in an offense littered with other elite talents. Doesn't hurt his chance that he was deemed open on 84% of his targets last season.                                                </div>

<br />
The target rate per route ranked dead-last among 73 qualifying players last season that commanded at least 100 targets. <br />
<br />
It's clear that Boyd can't be viewed as much working as a clear ancillary piece of the Cincinnati passing attack. Tight end C.J. Uzomah's departure does open up the potential that Boyd could shoulder a larger target workload, but his upside remains extremely limited while Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are healthy.                                                </div>

The Commanders are hell-bent on capping Antonio Gibson's ceiling, but you can't fault them because McKissic remains one of the best receiving backs in the NFL. Last season he ranked fourth in target share and yards per route run among running backs. McKissic could see a hit to his raw volume and touchdown expectations (which were already low) if Brian Robinson gets involved on early downs and even a smidge in the passing game. Because of this, McKissic is best viewed as an RB4 with some upside.                                                </div>

<br />
There's a chance that PFF's highest-graded running back from the FBS (92.0) in 2021 carves out a role on early downs even though the team added Marlon Mack this offseason. News flash, people - Mack signed a one-year, $two-million deal with Houston, and it's less than the team is paying Rex Burkhead..1 million of Burkhead's $2.35 million contract is fully guaranteed.<br />
<br />
We could easily see Mack released as much as we could see Pierce become the team's starting running back.<br />
<br />
Although my one reservation with Pierce is that traditionally New England has been very stingy about featuring rookie running backs historically - especially ones drafted late. During Nick Caserio's tenure with the Patriots, Stevan Ridley's 87 carries were the most for any non-first-round rookie running back.<br />
<br />
It was until Caserio left New England for Houston, that Rhamondre Stevenson broke that mark with 133 carries in 2021.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, there's clearly an affinity with veteran running backs that Texans can't seem to quit. They force-fed David Johnson and Mark Ingram II among other veterans last season, despite having some younger players they could give reps to.<br />
<br />
Caserio's post-draft press conference cited Pierce as someone that needs to earn a role and be a factor on special teams. So pump the brakes on Pierce RB1 szn ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
The fact Pierce never fully took over Florida's backfield does raise red flags. His 12% career dominator rating is eerily similar to Trey Sermon (12%) from last season, and Sermon struggled to separate himself from the pack in his rookie campaign. <br />
<br />
Even during his breakout senior season, the 5-foot-10 and 218-pound running back earned just a 22% dominator rating while sharing the backfield alongside fellow draft-eligible running back Malik Davis.<br />
<br />
However, I am willing to offer some benefit of the doubt after Pierce never topped 106 carries in college.<br />
<br />
There may have been some underlying issue with former Gators head coach Dan Mullen that prevented Pierce from seeing a more featured role. Case in point: Pierce only had two games with double-digit carries in 2021, both of which came after Mullen was fired toward the end of the season. <br />
<br />
Pierce's lackluster dominator rating doesn't capture his coach's potential ineptitude. The fact Pierce competed with NFL talent like Jordan Scarlett and La'Mical Perine very early in his college career paints a better picture of how his impact will be felt in years to come. But from the get-go, I doubt we see Pierce be a major fantasy factor to start the 2022 season.                                                </div>

But Moore has a chance to hit the ground running in the post-Tyreek Hill era, competing for targets with fellow newcomers Juju Smith Schuster and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. His impressive YAC ability - tied for first with 26 forced missed tackles in 2021 - and ability to play both inside/outside helps him stand out from the other Chiefs WRs. With Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback, Moore could smash his current ECR into the stratosphere. It's not that outlandish to think a second-rounder can make an immediate impact considering six of the 12 highest-scoring Round 1 & 2 rookie WRs selected since 2017 were second-rounders.                                                </div>

<br />
The tight end/slot receiver hybrid finished sixth in receptions, ninth in receiving yards, fourth in route participation (78%), and fifth in target share (17%) through 18 weeks of action of the 2021 season. This receiving and route volume led to only moderate success in fantasy football, as Mike Gesicki finished as TE9.<br />
<br />
His efficiency metrics left something to be desired, though - he was 13th in fantasy points per game (9.9) and 15th in yards per route run. Part of that does fall on the up-and-down quarterback play, but it just further cements Gesicki as a good, not great tight end in fantasy football. <br />
<br />
My biggest concern is that Gesicki has almost always underwhelmed after the catch - which will likely be a large part of the Dolphins new-look offense. His 3.2 YAC/reception ranked 41st of out 42 qualifying tight ends. <br />
<br />
Gesicki did deliver worthwhile fantasy production at times, as displayed by his TE6 standing from Weeks 3-15 (11.5 fantasy points per game). And 94% of his snaps came lined up in the slot or out wide in 2021, which is another advantage for creating mismatches.<br />
<br />
But all in all, he tends to only rise to the occasion for fantasy purposes when targets become available in the offense because of injuries to other players. <br />
<br />
The athletic tight end will end up meeting his mid-range 2022 ADP/ECR based on his consistent play the past two seasons, but won't enter the top-tier fantasy tight end conversation.                                                </div>

<br />
Isaiah Spiller represents the latest rehash of the Chargers trying to find an appropriate thunder to Austin Ekeler's lightning, and I for one think Spiller is already the best bet currently on the roster. The former Texas A&M running back has the capacity for three-down spot start duties with an all-encompassing skill set and desirable size - 6-feet and 217 pounds .<br />
<br />
Spiller should be a solid producer for the Chargers if given the opportunity although his lack of top-notch speed could keep him from being elite. He had only eight carries of 20-plus yards in 2021.<br />

But I'd be hard-pressed to ignore his impressive age-adjusted production as one of his most encouraging traits. Since Day 1 at Texas A&M, Spiller has been the lead dog for the Aggies.<br />
<br />
As a true freshman in 2019, he scored 10 rushing touchdowns and finished 16th in the nation in yards after contact per attempt en route to a 22% dominator rating.<br />
<br />
The power running back capped off his first year in impressive fashion with back-to-back seasons of 1,000 rushing yards and 100 missed tackles. Spiller also displayed receiving prowess, commanding at least an 8% target share and an average of 25 receptions per season.<br />
<br />
With Justin Jackson still an unsigned free agent, Spiller looks slated for instant impact in Year 1.                                                </div>

This is a perfect time to buy the dip for a talented second-year wide receiver.                                                </div>

The former first-round pick had at least seven targets in seven of his nine game played, scoring double-digit fantasy points in more than half of them. He averaged 12.9 expected fantasy points per game through 17 weeks (28th). <br />
<br />
His acquisition by the Patriots helps shore up the need for a big-bodied wide receiver on the perimeter that can make plays downfield. But the extent of how high a target share Parker will command remains to be seen. If anything, he probably has the most touchdown upside of the New England Patriots WRs.<br />
<br />
Just don't be overly bullish on him being available all season-long, as his injury history proceeds him. His 1.48 yards per route run was also his worst mark since 2018 as was his 55% catch rate.                                                </div>

It's a three-year deal worth up to $36 million. Essentially the same money that Russell Gage got from the Buccaneers and what Zay Jones got from Jacksonville.<br />
<br />
The ex-Packers field stretcher has ranked inside the top-5 in yards per reception over the last two seasons, so he will feel right at home catching bombs from Patrick Mahomes. <br />
<br />
He is sure to experience spiked weeks of production attached to the Chiefs' big-armed quarterback, but valuing him more than a weekly boom-or-bust fantasy WR3/4 would be malpractice. <br />
<br />
MVS does get a bump up in the WR rankings with a slight upgrade at QB and the opportunity to see a larger target share, but I wouldn't view him too dissimilarly to how he was perceived in Green Bay for the past four seasons. He has never commanded 75 targets in a season.<br />
<br />
His 2022 wide receiver ranking is comfortably behind JuJu Smith-Schuster and Skyy Moore.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Somebody on the Miami Dolphins is in for a rude awakening come September. Mike Gesicki, Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill are all being pushed up the rankings/draft boards with hopes that Tua Tagovailoa takes a massive step forward in Year 3 under first-year head coach Mike McDaniel.<br />
<br />
I am not as optimistic that Tagovailoa can be the vehicle to deliver fantasy goodness to all these pieces in South Beach because this offense is going to be run-heavy. McDaniel made his way up the coaching ranks under Kyle Shanahan as a standout run-game coordinator. And should he follow in the footsteps of Shanahan as the offensive mastermind in Miami, fantasy managers should expect a lot of rushing and YAC schemes.<br />
<br />
49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo ranked 29th in aDOT in 2021 (7.6) after ranking 39th and 35th in the category the two years prior.  Tagovailoa's aDOT was 34th in the league (7.6) in 2021. <br />
<br />
Jimmy G's most productive seasons have seen him average just north of 16 fantasy points per game - good for QB17 in 2021. Tagovailoa has yet to eclipse 14 fantasy points per game two years into his career. He also ranked 31st in throwing at the intermediate level (62.5 PFF grade) among 37 qualifying passers last season.<br />
<br />
So although Tua is viewed as a popular late-round quarterback among fantasy circles, I have to admit I won't be pulling the trigger on him in 1QB redraft formats. Especially with his brutal early schedule. New England, Baltimore and Buffalo are hardly the stream-worthy spots you will be confident in starting the southpaw QB. In the Dolphins quarterback's four combined starts versus those teams in 2021, his fantasy finishes were QB23, QB24, QB18 and QB16.                                                </div>

When Swift was out and Williams was active, he played 42-47% of snaps with 18 rushing attempts and 74 rushing yards per game. Williams isn't the sexiest handcuff or late-round selection, but the Lions' offense should take another step forward this year, and Williams will be the primary back if Swift were to miss time again.                                                </div>

Losing Allen Robinson hurts even more with the team replacing him with Byron Pringle, Equanimeous St. Brown, David Moore, and Velus Jones. The massive weekly upside is still in the cards for Fields with his playmaking ability, but he's tough to trust as anything more than a QB2 or matchup play, considering the cast of characters surrounding him.                                                </div>

<br />
The former Buccaneer took a major step backward in 2021, being regulated to strict backup duties after losing out on the starting gig in Tampa Bay to Leonard Fournette. And even when loaded to take on the bell-cow role with Fournette sidelined during the end of the season, RoJo failed to fire.<br />
<br />
He earned 20 carries in Week 16 versus the Panthers but totaled just 65 yards. The plodding runner also finished 51st out of 64 qualifying running backs in yards after contact per attempt (2.5).<br />
<br />
Jones is a one-dimensional grinder back, whose fantasy value will be super reliant on carry-volume, offensive line play, and overall offensive efficiency.<br />
<br />
That in itself means he will have fantasy appeal as a late-round running back in redraft if he can carve out a role on early-down and/or at the goal-line in a high-powered Chiefs offense.                                                </div>

Chark has eclipsed 1.50 yards per route run in only one season (2019), so expecting him to enter this target tree and contend for the top option is asking a lot. His ability to stretch the field is real, as he's finished with a 119.4 or higher passer rating on deep throws in two of the last three seasons. If the Lions sustain injuries to their depth chart, Chark has shown the ability to lead a passing attack, but outside of that scenario, he's best viewed as a matchup flex play.                                                </div>

Allgeier shined with 4.16 yards after contact, ranking tenth among all FBS running backs with 100 or more carries last season (per PFF). Sadly he bombed his athletic testing and fell in the draft before Atlanta scooped him up. Atlanta may lean on this young volume rusher, but it's also conceivable that Patterson and Damien Williams eat into the rushing pie enough to render Allgeier an afterthought.                                                </div>

If he inherits Tyler Conklin's vacated role -- ninth in route participation -- he will turn heads in 2022, coming off a lost 2021 season due to torn meniscus injury.<br />
<br />
Chances are that the offense led by the new head coach and former Rams' OC Kevin O' Connell will feature a huge role for Smith. Last season with Los Angeles, Tyler Higbee operated as the true No. 1 tight end, running a route on 76% of the team's dropbacks -- the 7th-highest mark in the NFL.<br />

Just keep in mind that Smith underwent thumb surgery, with the expectation that he is back for Week 1.                                                </div>

His -72.3 fantasy points versus expectation were the most of any QB in 2021.  <br />
<br />
Lawrence posted a season-high 85.1 PFF passing grade in the season-finale, offering some hope that he can turn things around in 2022 with a new coaching staff in place.<br />
<br />
There's a strong chance that Jacksonville dials up the passing attempts with Doug Pederson calling the shots on offense. During his five-year tenure in Philadelphia, only once did the offense not finish top-10 in pass attempts.                                                </div>

With Allen Robinson in town and Van Jefferson returning to compete for targets behind Cooper Kupp, the arrow for Higbee is pointing down. He's nothing more than a streaming option in 2022.                                                </div>

The ex-Rams tight end ranked as the TE9 in fantasy points per game (PPR) from Weeks 10-16 while running a route on 74% of dropbacks.<br />
<br />
Everett proved he can be a featured No. 1 tight end for the Chargers coming off a career year. He achieved career-highs in receptions (48) and receiving yards (478) and wreaked havoc with the ball in his hands, forcing 11 missed tackles after the catch - sixth-most among tight ends.<br />
<br />
His peripheral metrics in Seattle's offense - 12% target share, 63% route participation and 17% target rate per route run - were nearly identical to Jared Cook on the Chargers offense last season.<br />
<br />
Cook finished as TE16 overall which seems like Everett's fantasy floor heading into 2022. The tackle-breaking tight end finished the 2021 season just .4 points per game short of Cook's average (8.3 versus 7.9) despite playing in an offense that ranked dead last in pass attempts per game (29.1). <br />
<br />
L.A. ranked third in that category last season (39.6). <br />
<br />
Breakout tight ends are generally athletic players who earn above-average route participation in high-powered offenses. Everett fits the profile of next season's star at the position.                                                </div>

Yes, this was also his career's lowest yards per route run, but even a watered-down version of Jones isn't a scrub. Now add that he's being air-dropped into one of the league's fastest, most pass-happy, and highest scoring offenses, and Jones becomes a magical upside ticket depending on where the market settles on him.                                                </div>

White followed up his final season at Arizona State, where he racked up 3.38 yards after contact per attempt and 2.25 yards per route run (ninth, minimum 20 targets per PFF) by blowing up the combine. White finished with an 84th percentile speed score and 87th percentile burst score. This looks like a crowded backfield on paper, but the team has shown the willingness to utilize one back as a do-it-all rusher and receiver. This would leave White as the Uncle Len backup plan with workhorse upside if the injury bug bit Fournette.                                                </div>

That Carson Wentz is nothing more than a glorified game manager at this point in his career. As erratic as Wentz is, Dotson should enjoy an upgrade over the collegiate quarterback play he suffered through. The lone bright spot for Wentz is if Dotson can use his speed to get loose deep, Wentz should be able to hit him in stride. Wentz was fourth in deep-ball accuracy last season.                                                </div>

He'll have to pick it up in the volume and yardage departments because repeating 11 receiving touchdowns (tied for the most among tight ends with Travis Kelce) is a lofty goal.                                                </div>

He set career highs in PFF grade (70.9, 10th), yards per route run (1.56, 8th), and yards after the catch per reception (7.0, first) among tight ends that commanded at least 50 targets in 2021. <br />
<br />
The Browns also released Austin Hooper, which should open up the opportunity for the athletic Njoku to take a major leap. Don't be too quick to forget that Njoku already as a top-10 TE finish on his career resume.<br />
<br />
And with Brissett under center for the first six weeks, I wouldn't be surprised to see Njoku lead this team in targets. <br />
<br />
Former Colts tight end Jack Doyle led the Colts in targets/receptions in the seasons started by Brissett a few years ago, which suggests that Njoku could be a prime buy-low target. The Browns offense ranks top-three in target share to TEs over the past two seasons under head coach Stefanski.                                                </div>

Williams was 12th in yards per route run which helped fuel his 12th ranking in yards per touch. Conner should still be considered the workhorse, but Williams could steal some routes and touches as the season progresses. If Conner goes down, he proved that he could perform in an every-down role last year.                                                </div>

We could easily see Mack released as much as we could see him become the team's starting running back.

And he hasn't disappointed due to a lack of opportunities, either. He finished top-15 in route participation (68%) and had almost zero competition for targets with injuries to Kenny Golladay, Kadarius Toney and Sterling Shepard.<br />
Alas, Engram failed to command any worthwhile target share with his abysmal 14% target rate per route run. So consider me slightly hesitant to buy into Engram breaking out in 2022 because his new head coach has a history of featuring tight ends. Sure, it works in Engram's favor, but last I checked Dan Arnold is still on the team. And Doug Pederson has also been known to heavily feature two tight ends in his offense, which doesn't always translate to fantasy success.                                                </div>

The team has invested high-end draft capital in WRs in the last two drafts, with their latest pick in Garrett Wilson profiling as someone that could line up in Davis' spot on the perimeter. <br />
<br />
Still, Davis probably will be a starter to open the season, and he showed chemistry with Zach Wilson before he got hurt in 2021. The former Titan was the WR25 in half-point scoring with a 21% target share. He never played a game with fewer than 5 targets through his first six games.                                                </div>

They ran a slow as molasses offense, relying on their run game and limiting Winston to 25.2 pass attempts and 185.7 passing yards per game. This could easily be the case again in 2022, but there are some reasons for optimism here. Winston will be entering his third season of this offensive scheme, so he should know it inside and out by now. Hopefully, the Saints get Michael Thomas back healthy to pair with newly drafted Chris Olave. This moves Marquez Callaway into a more reasonable WR3 role. This cast of weapons with Alvin Kamara also on board could lead to more passing attempts that we didn't see in 2021.                                                </div>

<br />
The Chiefs adding a plethora of WRs in free agency along with second-rounder Skyy Moore in the NFL Draft hints they aren't expecting a massive leap for Hardman. <br />
<br />
My advice is to not get overly aggressive drafting a player that has yet to rid the role of a gadget player since entering the league. Because although the thought of a speedy wide receiver attached to Patrick Mahomes is enticing the on-field production really has not been there for Hardman even from a spiked-weeked perspective.<br />
<br />
Case in point, he has finished a a top-18 weekly WR in PPR once in three years to go along with a handful of 18-20th overall finishes.                                                </div>

But with coming off a torn ACL and J.K. Dobbins entrenched as the 1A starter in the Ravens backfield, is the efficient GusBu even worth the squeezer in fantasy football?<br />
<br />
Consider in his best season, 2021, Edwards finished RB35 in 0.5 PPR scoring. That low-end RB3 upside is gone now. He can't be viewed as much of anything but a hand-cuff to Dobbins, with hopes that he can also occasionally find the end zone to make up for a lack of pass-game work. Because ten touches per game in the form of carries is going to do literally nothing to help your fantasy lineup. Do not buy into the fallacy that Edwards owns "stand-alone value."                                                </div>

<br />
Injuries and off-field issues plagued Pickens' draft stock, but he looks fully healthy based on his testing at the NFL Combine. And Pittsburgh seems like the right spot for him to get his head on straight.<br />
<br />
I already can't wait for the heated training camp fights between him and Chase Claypool as the gloves come off - well not really - for target supremacy.<br />
<br />
Pickens' college profile screams that of a true alpha, so I'd be looking to stash him across the board before he is fully unleashed. <br />

The Georgia Bulldog WR broke out as a true 18-year old freshman, finishing 2019 as PFF's the 17th-highest-graded receiver in the nation (88.0) - ahead of future NFL wideouts like Jerry Jeudy, Justin Jefferson, Devonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle.                                                </div>

Atlanta traded Matt Ryan to the Colts for a 2022 third-round pick. <br />
It's a major upgrade for Ryan's fantasy appeal that he was able to get out of Atlanta - a franchise that looks to be in a massive rebuild. Last season, Ryan lacked a strong supporting cast which contributed to his lackluster numbers. <br />
Calvin Ridley played five games, and the Falcons owned the league's second-worst blocking offensive line per PFF. Ryan faced pressure at the sixth-highest rate (40%). <br />
That won't be the case in Indianapolis with a better offensive line in place, a stable running game, and playmakers like Michael Pittman Jr. and Jonathan Taylor to boot.<br />
Ryan was also vastly underrated as a passer despite the ongoing turmoil ranking above average in many of PFF's sticky efficiency metrics in 2021: 12th in PFF passing grade from a clean pocket, second throwing at the intermediate level, and ninth throwing on early downs.<br />
Entering a Frank Reich system that prides itself on churning out play-action (5th) and screen passes (10th) will make Ryan's life a helluva lot easier than it was in Atlanta.<br />
Ryan ranked 33rd in screen throw rate and 12th in play-action rate in 2021. The new Colts quarterback is back on the fantasy QB2 radar for 2022.                                                </div>

The former Rams running back performed admirably in relief of Darrell Henderson Jr., but he was immediately supplanted by Cam Akers once the second-year back was deemed healthy enough to play a full-time role.<br />
He signed a 1 year, $1.75M contract with the Miami Dolphins this offseason, joining a backfield with Chase Edmonds and Raheem Mostert. Michel offers the least explosiveness of the bunch but has the most proven track record of shouldering a workload that translates into fantasy production at 5-foot-11 and 216 pounds. <br />
<br />
Considering neither Edmonds nor Mostert (entering age 30-season) have ever commanded a consistent three-down workload, Michel has super interesting appeal if he becomes the No. 1 runner in the Miami backfield. Don't rule it out despite his very mediocre one-year contract.                                                </div>

Last year when he was called upon to carry the load in the Big Easy, he stepped up. In his three games as the lead back, he averaged 18 touches and 95 total yards finishing as the RB24, RB8, and RB15. He ranked 27th in yards after contact per attempt, immediately ahead of James Conner and Alvin Kamara (minimum 100 rushing attempts, per PFF). After his return to New Orleans, he posted 1.31 yards per route run which would have ranked 25th last year among all running backs with 20 or more targets (per PFF). Ingram is up to operating as the lead again this season if Kamara is out with a suspension.                                                </div>

<br />
Goff's average depth of throw has decreased over the last four seasons, with his most recent 2021 mark (6.8) ranking dead last among 38th qualifying quarterbacks. He has also averaged just 13 completions of 20-plus air yards the last two seasons. Williams finished top-seven among all college wide receivers in receiving yards on 20-plus air yard throws in 2021.<br />
<br />
However, Williams does also possess top-tier YAC-ability so he should be able to salvage some production when he returns from injury. <br />
<br />
And although Goff's lack of deep game isn't ideal, we have seen him fuel top fantasy WR seasons before in Los Angeles and Detroit. Most recently with Amon-Ra St. Brown, who was the fantasy WR3 to close out last season. Williams commanded a 31% dominator rating last season by hanging 1,561 receiving yards, 20 yards per reception and 15 touchdowns - all achievements that ranked top-three among his 2022 NFL Draft class.<br />
<br />
Nobody will be shocked to see Williams out-produce the combination of St. Brown and T.J. Hockenson once he is fully acclimated into the offense.                                                </div>

He got exposed without offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and weapons last season in 2021, finishing the season with his lowest passer rating to date as a Titan (88.1, 23rd). Tannehill's passer rating off play action throws also fell off (96.1 versus 109.5). 2022 is going to be a rude awakening for Tannehill, who has the largest cap hit in the NFL this year ($38.6M).                                                </div>

<br />
Entering his age-32 season it remains to be seen whether Jones can keep up his steady production in a brand new offense with new pieces littered throughout. However, the fact that he will be starter on the outside in a pass-happy offense is not being considered enough in his WR78 ADP. <br />
<br />
He's hardly a breakout candidate by any means, but his 120 targets and 19% target share from Trevor Lawrence last season due lend some credence that he's priced at his absolute floor, with WR3 range very realistic with his projected full-time role. <br />
<br />
His 17 end-zone targets last season ranked fourth-most among all players in 2021.                                                </div>

The problem for Thomas is that even assuming he's fully healthy in 2022, the path to repeating his TE5 in fantasy points per game finish (2020) will be difficult. Thomas hasn't been an efficient player as a starting tight end, ranking 41st and 22nd in yards per route run in each of the last two seasons (minimum 20 targets per PFF). With the addition of Carson Wentz, the team could easily be a run-oriented squad. If that doesn't come to fruition, the return of J.D. McKissic, the addition of Jahan Dotson, and the possible resurrection of Curtis Samuel could severely dent his 2022 outlook and target expectations.                                                </div>

He also cracked starting lineups as a fantasy WR3 at 44% clip and posted just one fewer top-24 finish than his veteran teammate during the entire 2021 season.<br />

If Thielen starts to break down entering his age 32-season, Osborn would be the prime benefactor in a more pass-happy, fantasy-friendly and 11-personell Vikings offense under new head coach and play caller Kevin O'Connell. <br />

His separation skills - 71st percentile, equal to Keenan Allen and 92nd percentile vs single coverage - further showcase his versatility.                                                </div>

<br />
Coaches lie all the time so I wouldn't overreact, but Robinson owning a legitimate 1B role on offense isn't shocking based on Gibson's injuries and their investment in the Alabama running back in this year's draft.<br />
<br />
Robinson finished third in missed tackles and seventh in PFF rushing grade (90.4) while also flashing his chops in the passing game last season. He caught 35 of 38 targets for 296 receiving yards.<br />
<br />
Robinson is far from a can't-miss prospect but offers the physicality and size to be a thumper for the Commanders.                                                </div>

The former Falcon is in sole possession of C.J. Uzomah's vacated role from last season offers some fantasy appeal.<br />
<br />
Uzomah's 78% route participation ranked fourth-highest among tight ends in 2021<br />
<br />
Every-down tight ends on the field that often in high-scoring environments will stumble into fantasy scoring. It's a highly coveted role primed to ooze fantasy points. However, being on the field doesn't always translate to the requisite fantasy production especially in offenses loaded with other weapons. Uzomah's 13% target rate per route run ranked last among tight ends with at least 40 targets in 2021. Hurst's 15% target rate wasn't much better.<br />
<br />
It doesn't exactly inspire confidence that Hurst is the clear-cut late-round tight end to target in 2022, but he is well worth targeting late in drafts. Hurst is just one year removed from a TE9 overall finish in 2020.                                                </div>

Playing in a super pass-heavy offense will allow Crowder the opporuntity to soak up targets underneath, as he has done when healthy for the New York Jets. Just last year, the 29-year old commanded at least five targets in every single game he played without leaving due to injury. <br />
<br />
In those ten healthy games, the slot receiver averaged nearly five receptions and seven targets per game.                                                </div>

After such an impressive first season in New England, it wouldn't be outlandish to see Bourne earn more targets in Year 2. After all, his 70% route participation has room to grow.                                                </div>

Even with a new regime in place, it's doubtful we see Josh Jacobs utilized a ton when Derek Carr drops back to pass. If Jacobs were to miss time, Drake could also cut into the early down work even if Zamir White would be the primary back to inherit the bulk of those touches.                                                </div>

Maybe I have an eternal blind spot for Campbell, but I'm willing to reinvest for 2022. We need to flashback for a second and realize how talented Campbell is. During his final two seasons at Ohio State, he ranked sixth and tenth in yards per route run and sixth and first in YAC per receptions among all FBS wide receivers with at least 50 targets (per PFF). The Colts still have a void that needs to be filled behind Michael Pittman. If Indy passes more this season than consensus is projecting, one of these Colts' receivers will be a significant value in fantasy. My money rides with Campbell.                                                </div>

Despite residing in what we project to be a good offense, with limited burst and pass game upside, White is a last-round dart throw at best.                                                </div>

<br />
The Browns understand his limitations as an athlete, but his strengths as an underneath wide receiver can help him produce after the catch.<br />
<br />
Bell finished third in the FBS in receiving yards on the outside (1,097), second in total forced missed tackles (25) and 10th in PFF receiving grade (86.9) among his draft class.<br />
<br />
He's a perfect fit alongside prototypical No. 1 WR Amari Cooper and the speedy duo of Donovan Peoples-Jones/Anthony Schwartz.                                                </div>

Washington was 11th in neutral rushing rate last year, which could creep even higher in 2022. With their selection of Brian Robinson, this offense could be built around the run, which leaves Wentz as nothing more than a QB3 in Superflex or a waiver wire matchup target.                                                </div>

Last year he also finished 31st in yards per route run among running backs (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). While Evans might arguably be the better passing down back, if Mixon were to go down, Perine would own the early down work with the upside to take all the action.                                                </div>

Touchdowns aren't sticky year to year, so this isn't something we should bank on when projecting Scott in 2022. Scott's efficiency on early downs was simply meh, as he ranked 50th in yards after contact per attempt (minimum 75 carries, per PFF). While the backfield seems more streamlined for a weekly role for Scott with Jordan Howard gone, the Eagles could easily role with a two-headed approach with Miles Sanders and Kenneth Gainwell leading the way. Don't rule out Kennedy Brooks also working his way into the rotation. Scott is a player to monitor on the waiver wire unless injuries strike the Philly backfield.                                                </div>

Hubbard averaged 20.4 touches and 83.4 total yards per game over the next five weeks as the RB36, RB16, RB22, RB29, and RB20. Hubbard's underlying metrics weren't so pretty as he finished the season 45th in juke rate and 41st in yards created per touch. By the end of the season, the team worked in multiple backs with Hubbard. Monitor camp reports for Hubbard's standing in this backfield in 2022, but I'm currently projecting D'Onta Foreman to be McCaffrey's primary backup.                                                </div>

He completed 69.5% of his throws in that five-game sample while throwing for multiple touchdowns four times (three passing touchdowns twice). You might have to pinch your nose when you press the draft button, but you could be smelling roses a few weeks into the season.                                                </div>

While his healthy return to the NFL was a heartwarming story, Green shouldn't be viewed as a difference maker at this point in his career. That doesn't mean he can't be a productive NFL player and a matchup-worthy play in a pinch. Green ranked 54th in yards per route run last year, immediately behind Laquon Treadwell, which is as nauseating as it sounds (minimum 50 targets, per PFF). While that looks ugly from a macro view, Green flashed his veteran savvy against zone coverage. He was 11th in yards per route run against zone last season, immediately ahead of Hunter Renfrow (minimum ten zone targets, per PFF). Temper your expectations for Green this year, but look to flex him against zone-heavy teams in 2022.                                                </div>

Pierce figures to slide-into that vertical field-stretching role for the Colts vacated by veteran T.Y. Hilton based on the rookie's speed and vertical profile from his college career at Cincinnati. But how valuable of a role is that with the team committed to both Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman Jr. as the clear touch hogs of the offense. Not to mention, Ryan's deep ball rate (9.1%) ranked 32nd out of 38 qualifying quarterbacks in 2021.                                                </div>

<br />
Jordan also dominated the receiving usage over the team's last two games, running 40 routes to Pharaoh Brown's 18 and Anthony Auclair's five. It's a great sign that Jordan should lock down the primary receiving role at tight end in Houston, especially with Jordan Akins signing with the New York Giants this offseason.<br />
<br />
It's easy to envision Jordan carving out a solid receiving role in a lackluster/unproven receiving corps behind Cooks. He's an athletic tight end with YAC-ability that I will gladly draft as my second or third tight end across any squad.                                                </div>

Because his team-leading 21% target rate per route run on 99 targets does suggest that maybe he's not as bad as the market perceives him. <br />
<br />
Especially considering the wide receivers going into Year 3 drafted in Round 2 that have eclipsed 170 targets since 2018 is a solid group to be associated with. Those names include JuJu Smith-Schuster, D.K. Metcalf, Tee Higgins, Chase Claypool, Courtland Sutton, A.J.

<br />
But the dream of a full-time role for McKenzie will have to wait after the team signed former Jets slot wide receiver Jamison Crowder (WR - BUF) to a one-year $4M deal. He is making almost as much money in 2021 alone as McKenzie is over two years ($4.4M). <br />
<br />
Needless to say, Crowder will likely be the Day 1 starter in the slot and fantasy gamers will have to wait for another injury for McKenzie to see a fantasy-worthy role. Remember this coaching staff is the same unit that played 33-year-old Emmanuel Sanders (WR - BUF) over Gabriel Davis (WR - BUF) for 80% of the 2021 season.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt they will do the same with Crowder and McKenzie in 2022.                                                </div>

<br />
It'd be easy to brush off the McKinnon signing based on the mid-June timing, had he not fully taken over the backfield during KC's playoff run in 2021. In fact, from Week 18 through the first 3 rounds of the playoffs, McKinnon averaged 14.3 fantasy points (PPR) and over four receptions per game. When CEH returned from injury in the Divisonal Round, McKinnon doubled his touches (30 vs 15). <br />
<br />
With an established pass-catching background and obvious trust from the coaching staff to let him loose during the postseason, McKinnon should be considered with a late-round pick across all fantasy formats. <br />
<br />
As for Edwards-Helaire, it further creates doubt about his pass-catching role in the Chiefs offense.  His 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs in 2021. The mark was also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and McKinnon (1.15).                                                </div>

He was exactly that from 2019-2020, and there is no reason to think the 26-year-old won't pick up where he left off. During his last season of play, Watson led the NFL in passing yards and yards per attempt (8.9).<br />
<br />
Considering some best ball leagues are won in November/December, not September, he's worth stashing if you opt to wait on the quarterback position.                                                </div>

After selecting Trey Sermon in the third round of the NFL Draft last year, the team chose to park him firmly on the bench.

With the 49ers' heading back to the running back well with Tyrion Davis-Price this year in round three, Sermon could be parked on the pine or the inactive list all season. Unless we get positive reports from camp, he's not worth drafting outside of the final pick in any league.                                                </div>

Whether he struggled to pick up the playbook or the team shifted their preconceived notions on personnel usage in season, the fact remains that Smith didn't get the playing time that we projected entering 2021. Last season Smith still popped in per route metrics ranking eighth in yards per route run and first in YAC per reception (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). When he was on the field, the team did make it a point to get the ball in his hands as he led all tight ends in target per route run rate. Sadly, he eclipsed 60% of snaps played in only three games. If Smith can earn more snaps in 2022, there's still a ceiling to chase in the final rounds of your fantasy drafts.                                                </div>

Admittedly though, I'd expect Koo to regress positively closer to his 2020 form after finishing the season as PFF's second-highest graded kicker with the 5th best FG% (93%). Doesn't hurt either that he plays predominately in a dome.                                                </div>

In a small sample, Marshall was snatching opposing corners' souls from their bodies in the preseason, securing 75% of his targets with 3.93 yards per route run (per PFF). The upside could be quite nice as a (nearly) free dice roll late. Robby Anderson looked like he was on his last legs in 2021. Marshall could supplant him as the Panthers' third option behind D.J.

He is certainly capable of being more than a third-stringer after an extremely impressive 2021 campaign that saw him finish as PFF's highest-graded rusher (90.6). <br />
<br />
Johnson also delivered in his three starts, averaging a whopping 22.6 fantasy points per game. He's a great player to target late with the hope that he finds more opportunity in 2022. <br />
<br />
Kareem Hunt's contract ends at the end of the 2022 season, so the Browns could move on from him a year early with a mid-year trade and elevate Johnson to the No. 2 on the depth chart.                                                </div>

Wilson definitely has merit as a last-round selection, though. When he's been called upon, he's been a productive volume back for San Francisco. Since 2020 he's played 50% or higher in seven games averaging 19.7 touches and finishing as a top 20 fantasy running back in 71% of those games. While Tyrion Davis-Price and Trey Sermon muddy the "big back role" projection in this offense, Wilson can't be ruled out here. He has the opportunity to seize that role this season.                                                </div>

He finished the day catching eight of 12 targets for 65 yards to go along with two touchdowns (one rushing and receiving).<br />
<br />
He's worthy of as a depth stash because of his ability to command targets at a high rate: Berrios' 24% target rate per route run over the last two seasons ranks 14th among WRs with at least 100 targets.                                                </div>

Meanwhile, Marlon Mack signed a 1-year $2 million deal, and rookie Dameon Pierce was drafted in the fourth round.<br />
<br />
I envision Mack/Pierce duking out work on early downs, while Burkhead slides in as the primary pass-catching back after he ranked sixth in route participation over the last four weeks of the 2021 season. The receiving role is the one to target in this backfield for a team that projects to be playing from behind frequently.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Burkhead came over from the New England Patriots last year alongside general manager Nick Caserio, so there's a built-in connection from management to the field. It's no coincidence that Burkhead nearly doubled his career highs in rushing attempts, rushing yards, and games started in his first year with Houston in 2021.<br />
<br />
And over the past two seasons, Burkhead has flashed a high weekly fantasy ceiling. He's crested 22-plus weekly fantasy points thrice since 2020. Mack has totaled 21.5 fantasy points over that span.                                                </div>

While he was on QB23 in fantasy points per game, his efficiency metrics painted a rosier picture. He was 14th in big-time throw rate, seventh in yards per attempt, and held the eighth-lowest turnover-worthy play rate (minimum 20 dropbacks, per PFF).<br />
<br />
While Carolina looks like a lousy landing spot, Mayfield will be flanked by Christian McCaffrey and D.J. Moore, which isn't a bad start for any quarterback. If Ben McAdoo can recreate his former magic as an offensive coordinator, Mayfield could be an easy QB2 target with some upside. Before taking the head coaching reins in New York, he led an offense that was top 13 in yards and total points in back-to-back seasons.                                                </div>

Last year's depth chart was a perfect storm scenario for him to step forward if that was in the cards for his career arch. Sadly he only logged one top 12 tight end fantasy finish last year. The hope helium has been drained from his balloon. He's waiver wire fodder or a streaming option should injuries strike the Saints depth chart.                                                </div>

Jones averaged a 25% target share, 10.7 half-point fantasy points per game (27th) and 12.8 expected half-point fantasy points per game (18th) in the team's final five games including playoffs.<br />
He also led the team in total air yards (1,136).<br />
The former Raider is bound to be overlooked in fantasy despite a strong 2021 finish, so consider me a buyer in the very late rounds and in dynasty. Jones will be a starter on the outside and inherit the wide receiver role previously occupied by Laquon Treadwell.<br />
The former first-round pick finished the final six weeks of the fantasy season 10th in receiving yards with 381 - 64 per game.<br />
<br />
Jones, like Treadwell, also finished the last five weeks top-10 in PFF receiving grade versus man coverage - further bolstering Jones' case as a future playmaker on the boundary.                                                </div>

He ranked outside my top-40 dynasty quarterbacks as a rookie after being selected by the Texans in the third round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Mills was extremely shaky to start the year, sitting with the league's 31st-ranked PFF passing grade through his first nine games.<br />
<br />
The Stanford product turned it on over the final five weeks of the 2021 season, finishing with a 9-to-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio while averaging a respectable 17.4 fantasy points per game.<br />
<br />
With a full offseason ahead as the presumed starter, Mills is shaping up to be a strong fantasy QB2 with room to grow in 2022.                                                </div>

<br />
His big-body type will earn him looks in the red zone from new quarterback Matt Ryan among a very barren Indianapolis Colts receiving corps outside of Michael Pittman Jr.<br />

Alie-Cox should be the favorite to earn starting tight ends duties over second-year slot/tight end Kylen Granson after the Colts dished out a three-year, $18 million contract to the 28-year-old former college basketball standout.                                                </div>

Edwards can still carve out a productive NFL career, but the tantalizing heights I once envisioned in his range of outcomes have evaporated. Edwards was sadly ranked 98th in route win rate last season while displaying some qualities that could mesh well with Arthur Smith's offense. Edwards' size will fit in as well as his after-the-catch ability. While his overall efficiency was putrid, Edwards did manage to rank 16th in YAC per reception (minimum 50 targets, per PFF). He likely never develops in the high target share earner I hoped for, but he can still pan out as a decent WR3 or WR4 in the NFL.                                                </div>

Doubs broke out at age 19, so his top-tier production in the two years that followed should not have shocked anybody. He wrapped a bow on his college career with a top-10 dominator rating in the 2022 Draft Class, headlined by a 36% score in 2020.<br />
<br />
As a consistent downfield threat - 55 targets of 20-plus air yards the last two seasons - Doubs has an archetype that fits well with Rodgers. And so far this summer... that fit has been on full display.                                                </div>

As good as Fuller was in 2020 (WR8), the long layoff for a 28-year-old free agent wide receiver is concerning.

Arnold could overtake Engram as the Jaguars' top passing-catching tight end this season as the weeks roll on.

In 2021 he was seventh in targets per snap and tenth in yards per route run immediately behind Darren Waller (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). While people worry about Engram or fawn over his athleticism, don't let Arnold's efficiency and own gym rat chops get lost in the mix. Arnold has a 98th percentile burst score (per Playerprofiler.com) and 93rd percentile agility.                                                </div>

Pittsburgh never attempted more kicks than they did in 2021 versus recent years, so expecting Boswell to run back a K3 performance seems slightly far-fetched. His 89% conversion rate on 50-plus yard FGs is primed to regress. <br />
<br />
Although his routine 90%-plus FG hit rate does suggest he can be a low-end kicker or streamable piece if the Steelers offense plays conservatives with a rookie QB.                                                </div>

<br />
After all, Wilson is a 27-year old wide receiver that has yet to total 1,000 total receiving yards since being drafted in 2018.<br />
<br />
Leaving a high-powered Dallas offense for a Miami offense led by an unproven quarterback makes it less likely Wilson delivers as many spike weeks as he did in 2021 - even as a more full-time player.                                                </div>

Last year Brate was tied for ninth in red-zone targets in the NFL. While he was 56th out of 58 tight ends in yards per route run last season, Brate has flashed far more efficient seasons in the past (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). In 2020 he was sixth in yards per route run at the position while also finishing 16th in back-to-back seasons in 2016-2017 (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). Last season his aDOT dropped to 7.8 as he was used primarily as a goal-line weapon, but he could see it climb back to the 10.0 range he enjoyed in 2016-2017. Brate is cheap exposure to one of the best offenses in the NFL.                                                </div>

Marquez Callaway was the hype machine target last year, but sadly he massively disappointed fantasy managers. He finished the season as the WR50 in fantasy points per game. Callaway simply isn't a wide receiver that should be expected to lead an NFL passing attack. Last year he was 62nd in route win rate and 69th in route win rate against man coverage (per Playerprofiler.com). These lagging metrics explain why he was 59th in target per route run rate. This season he slides back to the middle of the pack on the Saints' wide receiver depth chart and the fantasy abyss.                                                </div>

<br />
He broke out in a big way as "the guy" for the Wolverines in 2021, earning a 23 percent dominator rating, raising his career dominator rating to 20 percent.<br />
<br />
With an identical PFF rushing grade to Breece Hall (91.6) over the last three seasons, Haskins looked primed to exceed expectations in the NFL. He offers a lot of size at 6-foot-2 and 228 pounds, so he can handle a heavy workload. The Michigan product also led his entire class in rushing attempts inside the five-yard line (29), which gives him a real shot at carving out a goal-line role in the pros.<br />
<br />
Haskins will never see the field as long as Derrick Henry stays healthy. But there's zero doubt in my mind that he's the clear direct back-up for Henry, who showed us last season that he is mortal.                                                </div>

McBride was the highest graded collegiate tight end last year per PFF, ranking fifth in yards per route run (minimum 20 targets). While the track record of rookie tight ends producing out the gate in fantasy isn't good, McBride won't be drafted in most leagues, but he's a name that should be monitored closely. If Zach Ertz were to miss any time, McBride would be in the conversation as a top 12 weekly fantasy option at the position.                                                </div>

That season he was the third-highest graded receiving tight end in the NFL while also ranking third in yards per route run (minimum 20 targets). Unfortunately, that was the pinnacle, as his yards per route run have fallen below 1.4 in two of the last three seasons. While the athleticism is likely still there, the production in 2022 probably won't be. Even if he can overcome Dawson Knox, the Bills have a plethora of weapons that are more skilled at drawing targets consistently. Even in the deepest of leagues, he isn't worth a draft selection.                                                </div>

The former Michigan Wolverine finished as PFF's fifth-highest graded receiver and 10th-best pass-blocker at the running back position. <br />
His 2.11 yards per route run ranked 4th-best among all RBs, which suggests he has a legitimate shot to take over third-down duties in the Bengals backfield. <br />
But there's a case to be made that he would also thrive if an injury should occur to Mixon with an equally excellent rushing skill set. Evans' elusive rating ranked No. 1 and his yards after contact per attempt (4.05) ranked fourth. <br />
Fantasy gamers got a glimpse of Evans potential in a feature role in Week 18, when the Bengals rested their starters. Evans played 56% of the snaps in the regular season finale, compiling 13.9 fantasy points - seven carries for 35 yards and four catches for 24 yards on five targets.                                                </div>

Last year he only logged three games with 60% or higher snaps while seeing 21% of his target volume in the red zone. Rudolph could fill a similar role alongside Cameron Brate. Brate filled a role eerily similar to Rudolph's with the Buccaneers last year. Rudolph ranked 31st in yards per route run and 21st in YAC per reception last season among tight ends (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). Rudolph will only be a matchup streamer in 2022 unless there are injuries to the tight end room.                                                </div>

Dulcich screams receiving upside after concluding his collegiate career at UCLA with an 84th percentile college dominator and 98th percentile yards per reception. Over the last two years, he ranked eighth and 20th in yards per route run and 24th and 16th in YAC per reception among tight ends (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). With Tim Patrick's season-ending injury and Nathaniel Hackett utilizing two tight end sets at the second-highest rate last year, Dulcich will have a role in this passing attack in year one.                                                </div>

<br />
His impressive season earned him a three-year deal worth $21 million with the New York Jets.<br />
<br />
But the Jets also signed ex-Bengals tight end C.J. Uzomah in free agency and drafted Ohio State tight end Jeremy Ruckert in the third round. The situation looks horrible for Conklin in a potential three-way tight end committee in a bad to below average offense.<br />
<br />
However, the situation alone has made Conklin virtually free across the board in early best ball drafts, and I think he's worth the late-round dart throw. The former Minnesota Viking should be the favorite to earn primary pass-catching duties.                                                </div>

Last year he was QB15 in fantasy points per game with a stacked skill player cupboard around him. Without any rushing upside to speak of and a pop gun arm Garoppolo's weekly upside is vanilla at best. He's a better NFL quarterback than a fantasy option. Garoppolo ranked first in pressured completion rate and second in play-action completion rate last year. A play-action-heavy system would be the best fit where he isn't asked to carry an offense but rather be an efficient point guard like he was with the 49ers.                                                </div>

The undersized explosive running back enjoyed a breakout season in his final season at Missouri stepping out of Larry Roundtree's shadow. His 916 yards after contact ranked fifth-best in the class.<br />
Quite the feat for a sub-200 pound running back. But what's more impressive is Badie's 124 catches during his four-year tenure in college - capped off by 52 receptions in 2021. That was the highest mark among all 2022 draft-eligible backs.<br />
There's no guarantee that either J.K. Dobbins or Gus Edwards will come out the gates hot coming off torn ACLs, so the 2021 sixth-rounder could see a larger role than many would expect from a Day 3 selection. At worst, he'd be my favorite to emerge as the No. 3 RB because I have zero faith in either Mike Davis/Justice Hill maintaining any consistent role on the Ravens offense.                                                </div>

<br />
The former Browns quarterback had an obvious connection with tight ends in both college and the NFL, so there should be some optimism that Tremble can do more in Year 2.<br />
<br />
The Panthers can't feature tight ends less than they have the past two seasons, ranking bottom three in tight end target share. It also works in Tremble's 2022 projection favor that he out-targeted teammate Ian Thomas despite running fewer routes. His 44% slot rate also ranked 15th at the position last season.                                                </div>

Last season he was the 16th highest graded passer per PFF while also sitting at third in big-time throw rate and second in adjusted completion rate (minimum 100 dropbacks, per PFF). While it's impossible to expect him to keep up this lofty pace for a full season, even borderline league-average play from Smith would greatly improve the outlook for all of the skill players in this offense, beginning with D.K. Metcalf and Tyler Lockett. While Smith won't be on my radar in drafts outside of sicko 16-team Superflex leagues, he might be good enough this season to support Seattle's other fantasy options.                                                </div>

He finished as the QB23 and QB28 in fantasy points per game in 2017 and 2019 while starting at least 15 games each season. Brissett was the 33rd and 35th highest graded passer per PFF, with anemic big-time throw rates ranking 39th and 42nd. While Deshaun Watson is suspended, the Browns can only hope for game manager level play as they attempt to grind out wins with their running game and defense. Even if you're streaming quarterbacks in fantasy, Brissett is unlikely to make the list often this season.                                                </div>

First, he was taken one spot before me by FantasyPros' own Pat Fitzmaurice after I waxed poetic about him on Pat's Fitz on Fantasy podcast. Then he got swept up right before my pick in another dynasty rookie draft.<br />
<br />
I believe he has some sneaky Hunter Renfrow-like slot skill that most will overlook, but NFL teams like the Titans will love.<br />
<br />
Philips commanded a 30 percent target share in 2021 at UCLA and could potentially become a top underneath option for Ryan Tannehill in Tennessee.                                                </div>

Then the roof caved in, with Darnold throwing four TD passes and 10 INTs in his other seven starts. So much for the idea that Adam Gase was entirely to blame for Darnold's non-development. He's entering his age-25 season, so there's a flicker of hope left, but the Panthers' acquisition of Baker Mayfield suggests that they've given up hope of turning around Darnold's career.                                                </div>

<br />
The former Alabama wide receiver caught 96 balls for over 1,100 receiving yards and eight touchdowns in his final junior season. He just happened to be overshadowed by Ohio State transfer Jameson Williams.<br />
<br />
But don't sleep on Metchie because he possesses a nice skillset that will translate well with the Texans. He's a savvy route runner that understands how to get leverage and create separation from defenders. His game reminds me of Eddie Royal.<br />
<br />
He probably won't ever be a true No. 1, but that doesn't preclude him from carving out a niche role starting from the slot.<br />
<br />
But that will have to wait until 2023. Metchie was recently diagnosed with leukemia, making it likely he misses the entire 2022 season.                                                </div>

The former Texas Tech product hit 98% of XPs and 13-14 of his FGs his final year in school.<br />
<br />
Dallas did re-sign former CFL kicker Lirim Hajrullahu, so he would have equal fantasy upside if he beats out the rookie this summer.                                                </div>

He was a monster producer at Louisville despite his extremely small size at 5-foot-9 and 155 pounds. However, there's no doubt the guy will have durability issues at such a small stature as displayed last season.<br />
<br />
But a healthy Atwell could be unlocked by new offensive coordinator Liam Coen, who vaulted fellow small WR Wan'Dale Robinson to an uber-productive final season at Kentucky as the team's play caller.<br />
<br />
So far, Atwell has looked solid during the summer and received praise from Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp.                                                </div>

<br />
New Cardinals RB Darrel Williams played that role last season, and Gore flashed red-zone usage last season in Week 8 with six red-zone touches. Many will point to Gore's undrafted status as a reason to believe he won't be a factor in 2022. But the team's belief in fellow UDFA Williams suggests that the team won't shy away from Gore if he is indeed the best option for the job.<br />
<br />
He was superior to both Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Ronald Jones last season in PFF rushing grade and yards after contact per attempt. Gore was also uber-efficient in the passing game, finishing fourth in the NFL in yards per route run. It's a small sample size with just nine targets, but it's encouraging that he shows proficiency in the receiving game.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">After going undrafted, rookie Abram Smith signed with the New Orleans Saints as a UDFA with a $222,000 guaranteed contract - one of the biggest guarantees for any rookie free agent around the league in recent years.<br />
<br />
It's a strong indicator that Smith will likely crack the final 53-man roster, and his special-teams ability will be his pathway to being active on game day.<br />
<br />
Just dressing for games is half the battle for many rookies, so for Smith to have a realistic path as a UDFA should not be ignored. And neither should the general ambiguity surrounding Alvin Kamara's legal matters after he was arrested in Las Vegas during the Pro Bowl.<br />
<br />
If Kamara is suspended for any allotment of time, Smith is looking at a depth chart composed of Mark Ingram, Tony Jones Jr., Dwayne Washington, and Devine Ozigbo.<br />
<br />
Ingram just turned 32. Jones was a UDFA in 2020 and bombed in his lone start in 2021. Washington has been on the roster for four seasons and has totaled 47 carries.<br />
<br />
It's not far-fetched to think that Smith is going to have a role on an ascending Saints offense sooner rather than later. He would hardly be the first UDFA success story to come out of New Orleans ie. Khiry Robinson, Chris Ivory, and Pierre Thomas.                                                </div>

Harty saw an extremely high target rate per route run in 2021 (27%) and finished sixth in both PFF receiving grade (86.8) and yards per route run (2.69).<br />
He had over 52 receiving yards in three of Jameis Winston's starts last season, which indicates to me he has some built-in rapport with the quarterback. If a starting opportunity opens in the Saints offense, I'm confident Harty would deliver fantasy goodness.                                                </div>

He landed with the Titans, who don't seem to be in any hurry to replace starter Ryan Tannehill. Willis has a big arm and is a potential difference-maker as a runner, but he needs a lot of refinement. Whenever Willis gets his first NFL playing time, the results are more likely to be reminiscent of late-career Cam Newton than current Josh Allen.                                                </div>

<br />
It's important to denote that his deep-threat profile -- fourth in aDOT (16.7) in 2021 - suggests he will be the team's field stretcher on an offense filled to the brim with elite underneath options between Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow, and Darren Waller.<br />
<br />
The subsequent trade of Bryan Edwards further bolsters my take on Hollins carving out that No. 3 receiver role on a high-powered pass-heavy offense.<br />
<br />
He will never get doubled with all the other weapons on the Vegas offense, making him an extremely appetizing final-round best-ball option, especially in Raiders stacks.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Justyn Ross looked the part of college football's next superstar after a breakout freshman season. At 18 years old, Ross led the Clemson Tigers in receiving yards despite playing alongside older teammates Tee Higgins, Amari Rodgers and Hunter Renfrow who were future pros. He was PFF's second-highest-graded WR in his first season (91.2).<br />
The 6-foot-4 and 205-pound wideout followed up with an impressive sophomore campaign, leading the team in receptions (66) as Trevor Lawrence's most heavily targeted receiver.<br />
Ross was well on his way to being a locked-and-loaded Round 1 selection for the 2021 NFL Draft, but a rare condition affecting his neck and spine forced him to miss the entire 2020 season.<br />
He came back in 2021 to show that he was fully healthy, but an anemic Clemson offense that ranked 87th in PFF's grading torpedoed his numbers. Only 64% of his targets were deemed catchable, which ranked in the 28th percentile.<br />
He's an underrated route runner at his size, but not a contested-catch fiend. Reminds me a lot of Corey Davis because Ross is not particularly explosive.<br />
The injury concerns made Ross go undrafted, but he landed in the best situation with Kansas City.<br />
The floor is rock bottom, but Ross' experience playing special teams does give me some hope that he can stick to the bottom of the depth chart in KC. The talent is so apparent that I wouldn't be totally shocked if he makes some noise - health withstanding.<br />
<br />
But good health did no bestow Ross, as he was placed on IR by the Chiefs, thus ending his 2022 campaign.                                                </div>
