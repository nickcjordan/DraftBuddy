Taylor also led the NFL in red-zone touches (92), which was not that surprising considering he ranked fifth in that category as a rookie.<br />
<br />
That elite goal-line usage helped separate Taylor from the pack as the bonafide No. 1 running back in fantasy football. No player came close to sniffing his amount of volume near paydirt. Taylor's 42 carries inside the 10-yard line were 12 more than the next-closest back (Damien Harris, 30).<br />
<br />
Pairing Taylor's elite red-zone usage with his ascending role as a receiver - 11th in routes run and sixth in route participation in 2021 - makes him worthy of the 1.01 pick across all fantasy formats. No quarterback targeted running backs more than new Colts quarterback Matt Ryan did in 2021 - 8.6 targets per game.                                                </div>

He played in four games in 2021 with at least a 50% snap share and his PPR fantasy finishes were RB1, RB3, RB4 and RB3. McCaffrey averaged 26 fantasy points per game. Considering the extent of CMC's injuries have not resulted in major surgeries or completely torn ligaments, I like him bouncing back to form in 2022. I like that the Panthers are already putting him in preseason bubble wrap to make sure he's full-go for Week 1. Four of the Panthers' 5 wins last season came when CMC was active and playing.                                                </div>

At 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds, Ekeler finished 8th in the NFL in total touches (276) and 14th in touches per game (17.2).<br />
<br />
But the raw touches hardly showcase the fantasy value Ekeler possesses, because he often commands an extremely high-share of high-value targets ie. targets and red-zone opportunities.<br />
<br />
His 13.9% target share and 70 receptions ranked second behind only Najee Harris. Ekeler's 18 red-zone touchdowns and 63 red-zone touches ranked first and second respectively. <br />
<br />
With such a secure role as a receiver out of the backfield and as a featured red-zone weapon in a high-powered offense, it's hard to imagine a healthy Ekeler not returning at least top-5 fantasy status in 2022. He wrapped a bow on the 2021 season as the RB3 in points per game and RB2 overall in half-point scoring.                                                </div>

The Minnesota Vikings running back was a workhorse when healthy, averaging 22 touches per game (5th) and 15.2 fantasy points per game (RB11). But the market seems to have soured on the consensus No. 2 pick from a season ago, because he missed four games and his production didn't align with his usage.<br />
<br />
His ADP has fallen to the back of Round 1, and it's unwarranted based on the impending touchdown regression Cook will experience in 2022. His 15 goal-line carries ranked fourth in the NFL last season, but he converted just three into scores. Considering Cook averaged 16 TDs from 2019-2020, his meager 6 TDs from last season look like a blip on the radar.                                                </div>

The Steelers rookie running back managed a league-leading 381 touches in 2021, and finished as the RB4 in half-point scoring as a result. <br />
<br />
The volume he is going to see in 2022 will ensure he is one of the safest running backs available in fantasy football.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still, the issue with Harris pertains to his true upside potential in an potentially capped offense led by a rookie quarterback. An immobile Ben Roethlisberger was a check-down target machine to Harris in 2021 which may not be the case in 2022. <br />
<br />
And despite all of his total raw touches, Harris only saw 37 touches (22nd) in the red zone and scored six red-zone touchdowns.                                                </div>

The guy was essentially lapping the other wide receivers, finishing No. 1 overall in points per game, receiving yards (1,947) and target share (31%) with over 200 targets total in 21 games played.<br />
<br />
New quarterback Matthew Stafford elevated Kupp back inside the top-5 fantasy WRs - as he previously was in 2019. Stafford's arrival in L.A. was the code to cracking Kupp's untapped potential especially with touchdowns.<br />
<br />
After catching just three the year prior, Kupp led the league with 16 TD scores - a feat that has happened only six times since 2007. <br />
<br />
However, regression will also certainly hit Kupp's production in 2022, just because it's near impossible for him to repeat his once-in-a-lifetime production. Of the five WRs that caught at least 16 touchdowns, they averaged just 6.6 TDs the following season. Only two (Davante Adams, Randy Moss) were able to haul in double-digit scores.                                                </div>

The Tennessee Titans running back led the position in fantasy PPR points per game (23.4) through eight weeks and bested his 2020 2,000-yard campaign by more than 2.5 PPR points per game.<br />
<br />
The unicorn running back averaged 29.6 touches per game - seven more than the next closest running back before his injury. And although he didn't play again until the postseason, Henry still finished 15th in the NFL in total touches and as the RB20 overall in just eight games played.<br />
<br />
No running back better depicts the "volume is king" mantra better than the King himself and his guaranteed volume make him near bulletproof. <br />
<br />
Coming off an injury-plagued season does raise some concerns about whether Henry's body is going to break down because of his insane workload. And the lack of pass-game usage is a detriment to his value in PPR formats. But it's impossible to ignore his workload opportunity in 2022 within a Titans anemic passing offense. They don't have any reason to not feature him and there are no indications that they are going to stop with him due $15M this season. <br />
<br />
Seems more likely than not they ride Henry did his contract expires before the 2024 season when he hits age 30.                                                </div>

The Bengals running back finished the season third in total touches (334) and sixth in touches per game (20.9). <br />
<br />
Mixon also ranked third in goal-line carries (16) and tied Jonathan Taylor/James Conner in red-zone touchdowns. 2021 was the perfect storm for the fantasy RB3 in half-points scoring coming off a truncated 2020 campaign, and there's reason to believe the positive production will continue in 2022.<br />
<br />
The Bengals offensive line has been revamped entirely, ensuring that Mixon will be able to repeat his top-10 PFF rushing grade from a season ago. He also flashed upside a receiver down the playoff stretch for the Bengals, averaging nearly six targets per game while running a route on 57% of offensive dropbacks through six games. That route participation would have ranked third among all running backs during the regular season. <br />
<br />
Mixon fits all the criteria that a fantasy manager would want as a mid-range first round selection in fantasy football. However, he owns the RB7 ADP at 12th overall in early best ball drafts.                                                </div>

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end posted his worst points per game average (16.6) dating back to 2017 while also posting a career-low in yards per route run (1.84) and PFF grade (81.8).<br />
<br />
It seems logical that Kelce's reign as the perennial consensus TE1 has come to a conclusion as he enters his age-33 season in 2022.<br />
<br />
However, it's impossible to ignore the high-end target share that Kelce will command in the Chiefs offense after they traded Tyreek Hill. His 20% target share ranked second-best at the position in 2021. Although it was a slight fall-off from his 23% average target share from 2019 and 2020.                                                </div>

Adams' high level of play won't stop in Las Vegas, but his fantasy stock does get slightly dented going from Rodgers to Derek Carr. It's unlikely that Carr hyper-targets Adams to the length of a 28% target share as Rodgers has done for so many seasons. Incumbent Raiders pass-catchers Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow represent more target competition than Adams has ever played with since becoming the alpha in Green Bay.                                                </div>

His 29% target share fell to 24% as did his yards per route run (2.5 versus 1.8). This resulted in Diggs finishing with just two games with at least 90 receiving yards, a dramatic decrease from his ten 90-plus yard outings during the 2020 regular season. <br />
<br />
He finished as a top-15 WR just once through the first nine weeks of the season but improved down the stretch as Buffalo's offense hit its stride. He had three top-10 finishes as the WR8 in fantasy points per game in half-point scoring (14.8). <br />
<br />
Still, top-5 upside still exists with Diggs in this explosive Bills offense even if his target share holds at 24% in 2022. Because his command of high-value targets in the Buffalo offense was unmatched by almost every other WR in the NFL. <br />
<br />
He was one of just two WRs to hit over 2,000 air yards (Justin Jefferson). Diggs also commanded the most end-zone targets in the NFL (25) during the regular season - six more than the next closest receiver (Justin Jefferson).                                                </div>

The biggest issue with Lamb was that he never was seeing the requisite target volume in an offense that had a surplus of playmakers. <br />
<br />
Lamb boasted just an 18% target share last season - which ranked outside the top-30 among all pass-catchers.<br />
<br />
But with the 8th-most vacated targets left to be distributed between Lamb, tight end Dalton Schultz, ACL-injury returning Michael Gallup, veteran James Washington and third-round rookie pick Jalen Tolbert, I'd bet Lamb crests at least a 20% target share in 2022. His 21% target rate per route run bested anybody in Dallas last season. <br />
<br />
And that means more fantasy production will be on its way. Only once did Lamb fail to score double-digit fantasy points in a game where he commanded fewer than six targets in 2021.                                                </div>

<br />
He impressed the Buccaneers' front office - and a certain No. 12 quarterback - enough to earn a fat three-year deal with his old team worth $21 million up to $24 million. There's zero doubt with his performance and contract that he will be the entrenched clear-cut starter for the Bucs, and that's exactly the desired outcome for fantasy football.<br />
<br />
Fournette ranked fifth in fantasy points and fourth in expected fantasy points per game before his Week 15 injury, leading all running in receptions (62). Upon his return to the lineup for the Buccaneers' playoff matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, Fournette reclaimed bell-cow duties, playing 86% of Tampa Bay's offensive snaps to go with 22 touches for 107 yards from scrimmage.<br />
<br />
With an all-encompassing skill set at just 27 years old, Fournette possesses easy top-10 running back fantasy appeal. He slides inside my early 2022 running back rankings as RB8 because a fantasy RB1 is exactly what he has been in the Tom Brady-led offense.                                                </div>

The Baltimore Ravens fourth-year TE led the position with a 25% target share, 28% air yards share and 17.5 fantasy points per game. He ran a route on 84% of offensive dropbacks, which also ranked first.<br />
<br />
With Marquise Brown traded to the Cardinals, Andrews has solidified himself as clear TE1 with a still unproven second-year wideout as his main competition for targets.<br />
<br />
However, be aware that even if Andrews does repeat his efforts as TE1 it may not be to the extent that it was in 2021. His 623 routes run were 209 more than he had in 2020 and fueled the career-year. Andrews' increase in route running was tied to the Ravens boosted pass-play rate (56%). <br />
<br />
From 2019-2020, Baltimore passed on fewer than 46% of their plays. Because Baltimore's increase in passing was due out of necessity in 2021, I'd project it to regress closer to the 2019-2020 rate for this upcoming season.                                                </div>

<br />
It's worth noting that Hill posted a career-low in yards after the catch per reception (4.3, 42nd) and yards per route run (2.14, 11th). Hill's aDOT also dipped dramatically to 10.6, which was the lowest it's been since his rookie season.<br />
<br />
And It's undeniable that going from Patrick Mahomes to Tua Tagovailoa is a massive downgrade for Hill. Tagovailoa has yet to show that he can properly fuel a fantasy WR1, so it's hard to expect Hill to deliver a top-5 season with a lesser passer. Especially with Tagovailoa's lack of a confident deep ball, a prominent running game, and Jaylen Waddle also heavily involved in the offensive game plan. Sure, Hill will have his weeks when he is peppered with low-value targets in PPR formats, but the massive downfield touchdowns will happen much less frequently.                                                </div>

The Buccaneers wide receiver achieved his eighth consecutive 1,000-yard season and set a new career-high with 14 touchdown grabs, breaking his record from 2020. Double-digit touchdowns accompanied by a low target share is usually a sign to fade a wide receiver, but that's hardly the case in a pass-happy offense led by Tom Brady.                                                </div>

During his four-year career, the Browns running back has never averaged fewer than five yards per carry. But at the same time, he has also never played in a top-12 scoring offense.<br />
<br />
The best offense he played was in 2020 - 13th in points per game - which by no coincidence was also Chubb's best season from a point per game measure. The former Georgia back averaged 17.3 PPR points per game, which would have ranked sixth in 2021.<br />
<br />
The 12 rushing touchdowns definitely boosted Chubb's numbers, and scoring double-digit TDs is well within his reach with Deshaun Watson taking charge under center for the long term. <br />
<br />
Just be wary that Chubb won't be used as an every down back. Even when Kareem Hunt missed time in 2021, Chubb's role/usage didn't change drastically with the Browns sprinkling in other running backs on the depth chart. His 17-18 touches per game average the last two seasons shouldn't change even if the team trades Hunt this offseason. <br />
<br />
Chubb's role as a receiver also leaves a lot to be desired after he posted a meager 4.8% target share in 2021, averaging fewer than two targets per game (1.8). <br />
<br />
His path to upside is touchdowns and that's represented by his five top-6 weekly finishes last season - fourth among running backs.                                                </div>

<br />
But there's reason to believe that Samuel won't be able to sustain that same elite production from last season. Natural regression is firmly in play considering no WR earned more fantasy points above expectation than Samuel did in 2021.<br />
<br />
And that number doesn't come as a surprise considering nearly 30% of Samuel's fantasy points came from rushing alone.                                                </div>

The idea of Williams playing a three-down role was salivating, but Gordon's return should not be overlooked after a seriously underrated 2021 campaign.<br />
<br />
MG3's return definitely hurts Williams' top-tier fantasy ceiling. He's going to split work with another capable back in Gordon which is exactly what new head coach Nathaniel Hackett desires and spoke on at the NFL owners meeting in March.<br />
<br />
However, keep in mind that Williams finished 13th in touches last season (246, 14.6 per game) and would be the favorite to take another step forward in the passing game - Aaron Jones-esque - after finishing as one of two rookie RBs inside the top-15 in route participation in 2021: Najee Harris (first) and Javonte Williams (13th).<br />
<br />
Williams falls just out of the fantasy RB1 conversation for me in redraft and best ball, but he's right on the cusp. I don't think he can be ranked worse than RB15 considering that's where he finished as a rookie amid a split workload in a much worse offensive environment.                                                </div>

He will be the alpha dog for the Eagles and remain a fantasy WR1 in 2022 fantasy leagues. Brown finished fourth in yards per route run (2.72) and in target rate per route run (28%) despite battling injuries last season.                                                </div>

<br />
The best-case scenario for the Steelers' No. 1 wide receiver is seeing a boatload of targets - albeit inefficient like last season when he ranked second in that category - to deliver for fantasy.<br />
<br />
Whether it's Trubisky or the rookie under center, that is the reality with DJ. Let's not forget that last year's heavily-coveted rookie quarterback class produced almost zero reliable options outside of Brandin Cooks (WR20), Jakobi Meyers (WR33) and Kendrick Bourne (WR30).<br />
<br />
So with a top-15 early best ball ADP in an offense with more competition for targets between Chase Claypool, Pat Freiermuth, George Pickens and Calvin Austin III, I would need Johnson to fall significantly in drafts before selecting him.                                                </div>

He also finished the season tied for the league's eighth-highest target share (24%), which was 11 percentage points higher than the next closest Colt, Zach Pascal, at 13%.<br />
<br />
He also made 18 highlight-reel contested catches - fourth most in the NFL. And his 31% target share from Weeks 13-18 cemented his place in Indy's WR1 chair heading into 2022. <br />
<br />
With Matt Ryan under center Pittman has the volume potential to be a top-12 fantasy option. Ryan has a history of fueling top-end fantasy WRs like Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley, making a top-five finish not all that crazy for Big Mike in 2022.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that last season, Ridley as the Falcons' No. 1 receiver owned the sixth-highest target rate per route run and ranked second among all wide receivers in expected fantasy points per game (16.5).                                                </div>

<br />
The rookie fell short of lofty preseason expectations, though, as he scored just one touchdown. Any other pass-catcher that compiled at least 1,000 receiving yards caught at least four touchdowns. And per PFF's expected fantasy points model, the Falcons tight end should have scored 5.6 touchdowns.<br />
<br />
With positive regression for Year 2 in his favor, draft the uber-talented Pitts aggressively everywhere in 2022.                                                </div>

Along with breaking Anquan Boldin's rookie reception record, Waddle commanded a 22% target share and 24% target rate per route run - 18th-best in the NFL.<br />
<br />
But with the expensive addition of veteran Tyreek Hill, it is less likely that Waddle is the clear-cut No. 1 receiver in Miami. Hill is coming off a season where he commanded the league's seventh-highest target rate per route run (27%). The trade moves Waddle down from a fringe WR1 to mid-range fantasy WR2 after seeing almost zero target competition last season.                                                </div>

Allen led the quarterback position averaging 24.6 fantasy points per game and a whopping 26.7 expected fantasy points - nearly three points more than the next closest signal-caller. The Bills quarterback's dual-threat ability - third in rushing yards (763) and rushing attempts (122) - provides him a fantasy ceiling that only a few other quarterbacks can match. No quarterback had more top-3 finishes or top-8 weekly finishes than Allen did a season ago<br />
<br />
That's why he's deserving of being the first quarterback drafted across all formats.<br />
<br />
Because even after taking a slight step back as a passer in 2021 - 104.9 passer rating vs. 97.9 passer rating - a higher passing touchdown ceiling exists for Allen in 2022. His 5.6% TD rate was worse than in 2020 and ranked just ninth in 2021. Case in point: despite finishing No. 1 overall, Allen ended with the 5th-most fantasy points under expectation.                                                </div>

Most wideouts that own this usage are no-doubt top-12 fantasy options, but Moore's abysmal quarterback play continues to hold him back.

But his inefficient production is partially related to the juggernaut of run defenses he faced down the stretch - San Francisco 49ers (twice) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers - when in fact no Rams RB ran efficiently. 95% of his rushing yards in 2021 came after contact - the highest mark in the NFL.<br />
<br />
Did I also mention he was never even supposed to come back at ALL last season due his Achilles injury? If Travis Etienne came back from his injury and failed to perform, would that be held against his draft stock? <br />
<br />
There's simply too much emphasis placed on Akers' production when touch volume is the key driver to fantasy success at running back. In the Rams' divisional playoff win versus the Buccaneers, Akers played 81% of the Los Angeles offensive snaps and out-touched Sony Michel (signed with Miami this offseason) 27 to three.<br />

I expect Akers to be dialed back in as the top RB next season in Sean McVay's consistent 1RB offense, where the team's lead back averages 20-plus touches per game. Darrell Henderson has proven he's nothing more than a replaceable running back that the Rams continue to try and replace. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, Akers has a cakewalk of soft-run defenses to open the season against the Bills, Falcons and Cardinals. Won't take long for Akers to pay off his early Round 4 ADP in a high-powered offense.                                                </div>

<br />
But the horrible quarterback play in the nation's capital limited McLaurin's fantasy production to fantasy WR25 status.<br />
<br />
Many will point to new Washington quarterback Carson Wentz as just another retread of bad quarterback play coming TMC's way, but I am much more optimistic. <br />
<br />
The former No. 2 overall pick has a proven track record of sustaining fantasy viable weapons - most notably Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman Jr. from a season ago. His 27 passing touchdowns, 7 interceptions and 67.9 PFF passing grade are miles better than Washington's 20 passing touchdowns, 15 interceptions and 58.3 PFF passing grade in 2021.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Travis Etienne Jr. was a standout college football running back for the Clemson Tigers from 2017 to 2020 and was selected by the Jaguars in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft -25th overall. However, his rookie season was cut short by a preseason Lisfranc injury. Some NFL personnel reported that Etienne could have come back towards the end of the year had the Jaguars been in playoff contention instead of being the league's laughing stock.<br />
<br />
Etienne is expected to be fully cleared by training camp, giving him a leg up on the RB1 role as the Jacksonville Jaguars install a new offense under new head coach Doug Pederson. With James Robinson attempting to come back from a torn Achilles injury suffered on December 26th, Etienne figures to be the featured back during this spring/summer.<br />
<br />
Do not forget what this guy did at Clemson with Trevor Lawrence (QB - JAC) as his quarterback. During his final season as a Clemson Tiger, he led the country in receiving yards and ranked second in receptions among running backs. Etienne also racked up the most rushing attempts of 20-plus yards (40) from 2018 to 2019 while only carrying the ball 20-plus times once since 2018.                                                </div>

<br />
The Los Angeles Chargers signal-caller is a certified stud - a top-five, elite-tier fantasy quarterback in 2022. Only Tom Brady and Josh Allen posted as many top-5 weeks as Herbert did last season. He and Brady led the NFL with nine 300-yard passing games. Since entering the NFL in 2020, Herbert has thrown for 300-plus yards in 53% of his games played. <br />

Even if his rushing doesn't stack up with the league's elite, Herbert's cannon provides almost everything he needs to close the gap.                                                </div>

Although the alpha wideout did rise to occasion under a small sample size last season, averaging 14.9 fantasy points per game (15th - same as his final season-long standing) without Wilson at quarterback for three games.  <br />
<br />
But I am suspect that removing their quarterback that led the NFL in yards per attempt (10.4), passer rating (133.6) and passer rating from a clean pocket (130.9) before his finger injury is going to create a much larger impact over a 17-game sample size.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">The Raiders offense looks to reach new heights in 2022 with No. 1 wide receiver Davante Adams added to the fold. And that greatly benefits the team's lead ball-carrier Josh Jacobs. A more efficient offense lends itself to more scoring opportunities, and Jacobs will reap the most rewards as the team's primary red-zone back.<br />
<br />
Last year's RB13 smashed career highs in all receiving categories in 2021 despite playing alongside Kenyan Drake and Jalen Richard. Injuries to the back-ups boosted Jacobs' role as a receiver slightly, but it was not the only cause.<br />
<br />
There was a deliberate effort to feature Jacobs more as a receiver with him catching at least two passes in 12 of his 15 games played. And more importantly, the receiving capability that Jacobs displayed puts to rest the narrative that he is "game-script" dependent. Whether the Raiders are winning or losing in a loaded 2022 AFC West, JJ has proven he can be used in all facets.<br />
<br />
Now the Raiders did elect to sign both Brandon Bolden and Ameer Abdullah this offseason to bolster their running back stable behind Jacobs. Bolden has been a special teams guy nearly his entire career, so I doubt he carves out any legitimate role on offense. <br />
<br />
Abdullah has been used as a third-down back on the several teams he has been on at the NFL level, but I am not ready to declare him as a huge threat to Jacobs' workload. Sure he might work in some, but not enough to hurt Jacobs' bottom-line value. The team also drafted Zamir White in the fourth round, but I would not expect much from White in year one based on Josh McDaniels' track record from New England of not featuring Day 3 rookie RBs. <br />
<br />
The new head coach is more likely to run Jacobs into the ground on an expiring contract as he did with Dion Lewis, LeGarrette Blount and Shane Vereen during his Patriots tenure.<br />
<br />
And besides, the red-zone role is the most significant for fantasy points, and that looks to be clearly in Jacobs' grasp.<br />
<br />
Two-down back Damien Harris was in the red-zone role for the Patriots last season and flourished because of it. He ranked fourth in carries (46) and third in rushing TDs (13) from inside the 20-yard line.                                                </div>

The former MVP ranked fourth in fantasy points per game (22.0) tying Justin Herbert with 12 weekly top-12 QB finishes. Still, Mahomes averaged fewer fantasy points per game than in 2020 (25.2). <br />
<br />
Additionally, the loss of Tyreek Hill cannot be ignored heading into 2022. The duo ranks second in combined passing touchdowns (41) since 2016 - despite Mahomes not becoming the starter until the 2018. Mahomes can't totally be written off as a top-five fantasy option - .QB4 without Hill through the first five weeks of 2019 averaging 25 fantasy points per game - but there's real concern about his top-tier weekly ceiling without Hill.<br />
<br />
Especially coming off a season where he posted a career-low PFF passing grade (77.5) and career-high in interceptions (16). He's likely being overvalued as the QB2 in early best ball drafts on name recognition alone.                                                </div>

The Jets selected the Iowa State product at the top of Round 2, signifying his status as the team's locked-in RB1 for the foreseeable future. Hall's three-down skill set suggests he never has to come off the field, and the sheer volume he garners will vault him into redraft top-20 running back territory. <br />
<br />
The Iowa State product totaled over 4,500 yards from scrimmage, 50 touchdowns and 80 catches over three seasons in the college ranks.<br />
<br />
A workload of approximately 240 touches - based on ESPN fantasy analyst Mike Clay's projections and how many touches the cumulative Jets RB1 earned last season -  would place Hall inside the top-15 considering every running back last season that hit that threshold finished inside that ranking.<br />
<br />
2021 fourth-rounder Michael Carter had his moments as a rookie, but the Jets know he's just a No. 2 running back. Anticipate Hall to shoulder 15-20 touches per game based on the workload that Carter received last season when Tevin Coleman missed time.<br />
<br />
From Weeks 7-9 with Coleman sidelined, Carter averaged 19 touches per game and a 66% snap share. Upon Coleman's return from injury in Week 10, Carter averaged 14 touches per game and a 55% snap share in the games they played together.                                                </div>

That's because McKissic caught 37 passes versus Dobbins' three.<br />
<br />
Guys like Derrick Henry can overcome the lack of receiving work because they are entrenched bell cows, but that's not the case with Dobbins in Baltimore with Gus Edwards also in the mix. Dobbins only slightly out-touched Edwards 86-74 down the stretch in 2020.<br />

It would be pure ignorance to assume that Dobbins will take over the backfield considering Edwards has been excellent with every opportunity he has received.<br />
<br />
Dobbins also ran extremely hot when it came to scoring touchdowns, scoring at least one TD in every game from Week 11 on. His nine total rushing TDs ranked 12th in the league and nearly doubled his expected output (5.5, 30th) - the sixth-highest difference at the position.<br />
<br />
Drafters have to understand that to invest in Dobbins as a late third-rounder or fourth-rounder (RB20, 50th overall ADP) he needs to run hot in the TD category coming off the season-ending ACL injury. They also should expect zero-to-little pass-game work with Jackson's tendency to not check down along with the additions of receiving backs, veteran Mike Davis and rookie Tyler Badie.                                                </div>

Hockenson and Logan Thomas failed to live up to their lofty projections (due to injury or not).<br />
<br />
But the process was still sound behind adding some of those players in the early rounds if you look at their per-game production. Speaking to Waller, the Raiders tight end came in third in expected fantasy points per game (14.6), which ranked top-20 among all tight ends and wide receivers. He also ranked sixth in points per game (12.1) and second in targets per game (8.5)<br />
<br />
The major concern with Waller in 2022 is how much Davante Adams will eat into his targets. However, I'd focus more on valuing Waller based on how good the Raiders offense as a whole can be with the addition of Adams. I'd be willing to forego one or fewer targets per game for Waller, if it means more scoring opportunities.<br />
<br />
The big-bodied Black Hole tight end is primed for positive touchdown regression after converting just two of his 10 end-zone targets into touchdowns in 2021.                                                </div>

It was unclear how productive Sutton would be returning from the devastating knee injury.<br />
<br />
But to start the 2021 season, the Broncos wide receiver looked like his old self. He averaged 13.8 fantasy points per game (17th) and had a 27% target share in Weeks 2-7 during the regular season. <br />
<br />
It wasn't until Jerry Jeudy's return from injury that Sutton - and the rest of the Broncos pass catchers - became obsolete in a crowded, run-heavy offense led by a combination of Lock/Teddy Bridgewater. Nevertheless, Sutton finished the season as the fantasy WR46. <br />
<br />
However, even in the anemic offense, Sutton still finished seventh in air yards (1,756), cemented in between Tyler Lockett and D.K. Metcalf, in 2021.<br />
<br />
Sutton has a real chance to recapture his elite form another year removed from his ACL injury. It also helps substantially that he has received an ultra upgrade at the quarterback position with Denver's trade for Russell Wilson. <br />
<br />
Wilson has always been an elite downfield passer - he had the sixth-highest passer rating on throws of 20-plus air yards last season - which plays heavily into Sutton's strengths as a vertical threat.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Lamar Jackson had a season to forget in 2021, as he dealt with a plethora of injuries/illnesses and regressed immensely as a passer. Two key metrics at PFF that are important to analyze for QBs are performance in a clean pocket and throwing at the intermediate level.<br />
<br />
Jackson ranked 28th in passer rating from a clean pocket (90.4) and 22nd in PFF passing grade at the intermediate level (70.0). Despite all his shortcomings as a passer, Jackson still finished the season second in expected fantasy points per game (23.8) and seventh in fantasy points per game (21.3).<br />
<br />
His expected fantasy point per game output marked the highest of his career thanks to the Ravens' willingness to throw more in 2021. From 2019-2020, Jackson had 37 or more passing attempts in a game only four times. He did so five times in 2021, with Baltimore throwing at a 60% clip. <br />
<br />
However, I would not anticipate the pass-heavy approach to continue into 2022. Their philosophical change on offense was forced out of necessity based on the injuries. But a lack of passing doesn't impact Jackson they way it does most other QBs with his greatest fantasy asset being his legs.  <br />
<br />
Jackson may never recapture his 2019 rare MVP form when he averaged north of 28 fantasy points per game, but a 22-point per game average seems like his norm based on his last two years of fantasy production. In 2020, he led all QBs in fantasy points per dropback. That cements him as a clear-cut top-5 fantasy QB.                                                </div>

Hard to argue with the choice to sign a three-year deal worth $60M attached to a young superstar quarterback, especially when that quarterback fueled a career-year. <br />
<br />
He stormed out the gate in 2021 as the WR2 in fantasy through the first five weeks of the season, averaging 94.2 receiving yards and 1.2 receiving touchdowns per game.<br />

Big Mike finished the season as the WR23 in fantasy points per game despite cooling off considerably in the later weeks in addition to leaving a boatload of touchdown production on the table.<br />

<br />
Brown posted a top-12 target share last season (23%) with Baltimore. The speedy wideout also commanded a whopping 27% target share back in 2018 at Oklahoma - the last time he played with Murray. Christian Kirk was WR12 during the last four weeks without Hopkins in the lineup. <br />
<br />
The Cardinals paid a premium to acquire Brown, so fantasy managers should expect them to use him plenty.  Brace yourself for Brown to skyrocket up 2022 best-ball rankings as a top-20 fantasy WR option.                                                </div>

<br />
With Courtland Sutton and Tim Patrick operating from the outside, Jeudy figures to become Wilson's go-to target in the slot unless K.J. Hamler pushes him out. Jeudy's efficiency metrics should also see a massive boost now that he's catching passes from a future Hall-of-Fame quarterback, but it remains to be seen if Jeudy will play an ancillary role as a red-zone threat.<br />
<br />
Upgrading from Drew Lock and Teddy Bridgewater to Wilson is great for Jeudy, but we have to remember that he is still an unproven fantasy commodity. Great route-running and separation skills aside, he hasn't scored many fantasy points the last two seasons.<br />
<br />
And that's not the case with every Denver receiver, because Patrick's production last two seasons earned him a three-year, $34.5 million contract extension. <br />
<br />
Even so, Jeudy should easily experience his best NFL season to date in 2022, but it may not be as great as some die-hard Jeudy stans would care to admit. There are a lot of weapons in Denver, and predicting Wilson's best option on a week-to-week basis was often a challenge when it was only between DK Metcalf  and Tyler Lockett. <br />
<br />
As with those Seahawks receivers, there are going to be inconsistent weeks from Jeudy. And his lack of red-zone usage makes him more susceptible to bust games without having a touchdown opportunity to fall back on.                                                </div>

Mooney also finished the last four weeks of the season ninth in target share (27%) and fifth in route participation (95%).<br />
<br />
With nobody worth much outside of third-year tight end Cole Kmet as legitimate competition, Mooney should build off his 8th-ranked 24% target share from last season. <br />
<br />
Byron Pringle, Equanimeous St. Brown and 25-year-old rookie Velus Jones Jr. should only encourage targeting the 24-year-old Mooney in 2022 drafts.                                                </div>

<br />
CEH finished 59th out of 64 qualifying running backs in yards after contact per attempt (2.4) and third-to-last in target rate per route run at the running back position (13%). The poor rushing efficiency is bearable, but the poor receiving usage is hard to ignore. Especially considering his calling card out of LSU was catching balls out of the backfield.<br />
<br />
His 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs - also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and Jerick McKinnon (1.15). <br />
<br />
Some may also feel that the Ronald Jones addition is the final nail in the coffin for CEH, but it's not that black and white. Don't get me wrong though - Jones is a significant threat to earn more carries than Edwards-Helaire after the former first-rounder posted worse rushing efficiency numbers than his rookie season. But full transparency - Jones was not much better ranking 51st in the same category (2.5). <br />

It's actually a positive sign for Edwards-Helaire that the team brought in Jones instead of re-signing McKinnon or Williams. Those ex-Chiefs backs were proven pass-catchers and limited CEH's role as a receiver.<br />
<br />
I'd presume that Edwards-Helaire will fully take over the primary pass-catching role - which was the reason why the Chiefs drafted him in the 1st round in any way - while also working in tandem with Jones as a rusher on early downs. <br />
<br />
Jones splitting work might also help keep CEH healthy after his 10 missed games the past two seasons. <br />
<br />
The other RBs on the Chiefs current roster include Derrick Gore (4th-year UDFA), Isiah Pacheco (2022 7th-rounder), Jerrion Ealy (2022 UDFA) and Tayon Fleet-Davis (2022 UDFA).                                                </div>

The Day 3 rookie silenced the doubters with an incredible hot streak down the stretch for the Detroit Lions commanding a 33% target share - 11 targets per game - en route to a WR3 PPR finish from Weeks 13-18.  <br />
<br />
But the elite late-season production comes with the caveat that De'Andre Swift and T.J. Hockenson were not healthy. Before their injuries, ASB was an essential non-factor outside a stretch from Weeks 4-6 where he commanded a 22% target share.<br />
<br />
The Lions' rookie wide receiver was an extreme outlier as he not only finished top-50 but 21st overall; that almost never happens with fourth-round picks. <br />
<br />
The path for upside St. Brown showed last season is what we should be pursuing, but be mindful that it will likely take more injuries with first-round pick Jameson Williams and veteran D.J. Chark added to the roster this offseason.                                                </div>

<br />
Big D's No. 1 tight end wrapped up the 2021 season sixth in route participation (77%) and third in overall routes run (586). The highly-coveted role within the constrains of a high-powered offense ensures that Schultz will be in the back-end fantasy TE1 conversation for the third straight season. <br />
<br />
Only Darren Waller, Travis Kelce and Mark Andrews have scored more fantasy points at the tight end position since the start of 2020. <br />
<br />
With Dak Prescott's trust firmly in hand and Amari Cooper out the door, it's possible that Schultz builds off his ninth-ranked 16% target share entering Year 5.                                                </div>

He's just one year removed from a WR17 finish in PPR between two injury-plagued seasons.<br />
<br />
Let's not forget JuJu had an elite sophomore campaign - 1,400-plus receiving yards - and he is still just 25 years old. With the most vacated targets available in Kansas City and Patrick Mahomes his new quarterback, 2022 will be a return to form for Smith-Schuster.<br />
<br />
He can operate from his natural position in the slot and benefit from the playmakers around him. After all, Smith-Schuster was at his best as a Pittsburgh Steeler during his first two seasons playing opposite of Antonio Brown.                                                </div>

His contract expires in 2023, and the Browns have a mighty stable of backs behind Nick Chubb including D'Ernest Johnson, Jerome Ford and Demetric Felton. <br />
<br />
If no deal is reached by the time the season starts, it would be much less likely that Hunt stays in Cleveland, making him a primed trade target for any team that suffers an injury at running back through training camp/preseason. .<br />
<br />
Last year Hunt was limited to just eight games due to a calf injury - but he maintained his effectiveness when healthy through the first six weeks of the season. He was a top-10 running back in PPR averaging 17 fantasy points per game averaging just south of 15 touches per game.<br />
<br />
Hunt's true upside will always be capped in a backfield as the Robin to Chubb's Batman. But should an injury occur to Chubb or another star running back, Hunt would easily flirt with league-winning upside if he is awarded the requisite volume to do so.<br />
<br />
His 6th-ranked yards after contact per attempt (3.54), 6th-ranked yards per route run (1.81) and 26% target rate suggest he's not slowing down entering age 27-season. All he needs his a change of scenery to recapture his rookie year accolades when he lead the NFL in rushing yards.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Damien Harris' ADP has dropped nearly a full round since the NFL draft took place and it's unwarranted. All the Patriots did was draft two Day 3 running backs who will most likely be red-shirted their first seasons. <br />
<br />
Harris should be the bellcow back for the Patriots in the final year of his contract as has been the case for many New England backs playing on expiring contracts. And should he see a heavy workload, there's going to be fantasy points to come by.<br />
<br />
In 2021, Harris finished 2nd in carries inside the 10-yd line, second to only Jonathan Taylor. The former Alabama back also led all running backs during the 2021 regular season in fantasy points per snap. <br />
<br />
As PFF's highest-graded running back (91.8) over the past two seasons, Harris needs to be held in extremely high regard. With one more year on his rookie deal, New England has all the incentive to ride Harris for the entire 2022 season.<br />
<br />
Although there is some risk that he will be used in a 50/50 split with second-year back Rhamondre Stevenson. Stevenson (93) and Harris (86) split touches nearly 50/50 in the team's remaining seven games. In the six games they played together, Stevenson slightly edged out Harris in expected fantasy points per game (9.3 vs 8.9).                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Joe Burrow finished the regular season as PFF's highest-graded passer (91.2) while also ranking first in super sticky stats like passing grade from a clean pocket (94.6) and passing grade throwing at the intermediate level (95.6). He finished the season as the QB8 averaging just north of 20.5 fantasy points per game. <br />
<br />
The Bengals quarterback has undoubtedly entered the conversation as one of the league's best real-life NFL passers, but might be slightly overvalued based on early best ball ADP with impending regression. He's the QB6 despite finishing as a top-6 fantasy quarterback just thrice in 2021.<br />
<br />
No quarterback scored more fantasy points over expectation, which hints that regression will hit Burrow in 2022. The LSU product also rushed for just 118 yards and two TDs. He rushed for fewer yards than Mac Jones, who is notorious for being ranked low across consensus due to his lack of upside as a rusher.<br />
<br />
However, there is a legitimate path for Burrow's upside to be further unlocked if the Bengals increase their pass rate as they did during his rookie season and down the playoff stretch. Burrow led the NFL in passing attempts per game (40.4) during his rookie season and averaged 38 passing attempts/23.0 fantasy points per game in his final six weeks <br />
<br />
An uptick in passing volume won't help Burrow's efficiency per se, but his fantasy numbers will be much more stable from week to week.<br />
<br />
Also can't forget to mention the Bengals revamped their offensive line as they look to not let their franchise quarterback get sacked 70 times - 22 more than the next closest quarterback.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">This past year Chase Edmonds was viewed as the Arizona starting running back alongside James Conner. He stood as the RB21 through the first six weeks prior to suffering an ankle injury. Edmonds ranked fourth in the NFL in receptions among running backs (four catches and five targets per game).<br />
<br />
<br />
Edmonds won't ever be a true three-down back due to durability concerns, as he missed seven games this past season. But used properly and kept healthy, there's no denying Edmonds can be a viable fantasy option because of his receiving and explosiveness.<br />
<br />
His spot-start usage/production in Weeks 16-17 without James Conner in the lineup - 23.9 expected fantasy points per game - showcases a running back who can deliver massive fantasy upside any given week.<br />
<br />
In 14 career games when Edmonds has commanded at least 11 touches - his average fantasy finish is RB18 (PPR).<br />
<br />
Edmonds should see plenty of work in a Dolphins backfield splitting snaps with Sony Michel and Raheem Mostert. Considering Gaskins' fantasy spike weeks in 2021 all came from his receiving usage, Edmonds should find similar success in that role with Miami.<br />
<br />
The late signing of running back Mostert and Michel might have some fantasy gamers soured on Edmonds. However, Edmonds was never going to see a full bell-cow workload. Losing out on some early-down carries to Mostert or Michel was to be expected. I'd still prefer Edmonds in fantasy due to the pass-catching and hope the other signings keeps his ADP at a value.                                                </div>

Justin Jefferson is an ascending rocketship that will only see his TDs rise entering Year 3, most likely coming at the detriment of Thielen.

The fourth-year back was unleashed down the stretch for the Bills, finishing as the RB3 in PPR scoring over the final six weeks of the season - 17 fantasy points per game. He gained the coaching staff's trust by earning 54-plus snaps to close out the season, the highest snap number Singletary saw all season dating back to Week 1.<br />
<br />
Buffalo also didn't let off the Motor Singletary when the team hit the playoffs, with the RB1 averaging nearly 20 fantasy points per game from the Wild Card Round through the Divisonal Round.<br />
<br />
With a proven track record and two years of bell-cow back usage in spurts, don't be surprised when PFF's fourth-ranked running back in rushes of 15-plus yards and seventh-ranked player in forced missed tackles in 2021 is the highly sought-after RB breakout that emerges from a high-octane ambiguous backfield.                                                </div>

They gave up Amari Cooper and lost two key starting offensive pieces on the offensive line with La'el Collins and Connor Williams for little return.<br />
<br />
They did re-sign Dalton Schultz and Michael Gallup, but early reports on Gallup indicate it will be close whether he's ready for Week 1 coming off the torn ACL. Dallas' biggest move in free agency and the NFL Draft to combat their losses was signing former Steelers wide receiver James Washington, drafting Jalen Tolbert in Round 3 and selecting offensive tackle project Tyler Smith in Round 1. <br />
<br />
With many other quarterbacks benefitting from better team off seasons, Prescott has fallen in my rankings well past his QB9 ADP making it less likely I draft him. He finished as the QB9 last year in points per game, and I'd argue his situation - aside from health - isn't as ideal as it was a season ago. His rushing also hit career-low numbers in 2021.                                                </div>

He finished 10th in overall team air yards share and top-20 in PFF receiving grade among WRs with at least 100 targets. <br />
<br />
So Smith's WR29 finish and WR42 standing in points per game hardly does the rookie justice while playing in a run-heavy offensive attack. From Week 7 onward, Smith never saw more than six targets in any game. <br />
<br />
I don't necessarily believe that Smith's targets per game will increase substantially after the team added A.J. Brown this offseason; that puts Smith firmly in the fantasy WR3 tier.                                                </div>

The kid's a certified stud and doesn't get the respect he deserves. The Raiders slot receiver hung a WR13 overall finish last season due to a spectacular late-season surge. <br />
<br />
He went over 100 receiving yards in three straight games (Weeks 12-14) while maintaining a 25% target share. <br />
<br />
From Week 12 onward, his production generated a WR8 standing in half-point scoring. <br />
<br />
Renfrow made the most of the opportunities he got in 2021, and that won't change in 2022. Adding Davante Adams and Darren Waller will make targets for Renfrow harder to come by, but stay rest assured that the shifty wideout will perform if either guy is forced to miss time.                                                </div>

<br />
He is turning 30 years old this season and finds him in a situation with Geno Smith/Drew Lock at quarterback. Lockett's infamous for his roller coaster production - four top-5 finishes, seven outside the top-36 in 2021 - and I expect no less based on his current situation in 2022. The major difference being the bad games will be more frequent than ever with the massive QB downgrade. <br />
<br />
Lockett averaged just 9.0 fantasy points per game (47th) without Wilson last season.<br />
<br />
With Lockett competing for targets alongside Metcalf in a run-heavy offense, he looks like a straight-up fade unless his ADP falls dramatically.                                                </div>

With him back on a high-powered offense and with the potential to receive goal-line touches, he could easily become a screaming value in 2022 like James Conner or Leonard Fournette last year.                                                </div>

<br />
Hackett's obviously had success with Aaron Rodgers that has translated into fantasy, so a top-five fantasy quarterback outcome is firmly in play with Wilson in 2022. After all, Wilson's long track record of efficient fantasy play is undeniable - he has finished among the top-six fantasy QBs five times since 2014.<br />
<br />
I like his chances of making it seven in 2022. Because Wilson is still among the league's elite passers when healthy. Before the finger derailed his season, Russ led the NFL in yards per attempt (10.4), passer rating (133.6) and passer rating from a clean pocket (130.9) before Week 5. Wilson also finished the season on a high note, averaging over 24 fantasy points per game in his last three contests.<br />
<br />
All in all, 2021 was a typical season for Wilson: peaks and valleys. He averaged 23 fantasy points per game from Weeks 1-4 and Weeks 16-18. In his six games post-injury, Wilson averaged an abysmal 13 fantasy points per game. Buy the inevitable 2022 dip on the future Hall of Fame quarterback in a new situation.<br />
<br />
That combined with a plethora of weapons in Denver, makes it very plausible he sees similar immediate success that other quarterbacks like Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford have had since changing teams late into their careers.                                                </div>

He was the fantasy RB1 over the final five weeks of the season.<br />
<br />
Seems more likely than not that the team rides Penny till the wheels almost certainly fall off to start the season, then turn to their rookie RB down the stretch. That makes Penny enticing as a late-round RB target for those looking for immediate production out of the gates.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Kenneth Walker III made a massive splash upon transferring to Michigan State in 2021, leading his class in rushing yards (1,634), missed forced tackles (89) and explosive runs (46) en route to winning the Doak Walker Award -  an honor bestowed upon college football's best running back.<br />
<br />
His success earned him a 34% dominator rating, which considers the number of touchdowns and receiving yards a player commands within their offense.<br />
<br />
The number is solid considering Walker commanded just a 4% target share in his junior year, catching 13 passes for 80 receiving yards. <br />
<br />
His massive accomplishments this past season were inevitable after he rushed for 13 touchdowns as PFF's 15th-best graded running back in 2020 as a sophomore at Wake. <br />
<br />
With the second-most missed tackles forced over the past two seasons - trailing only Iowa State's Breece Hall - and third-most rushing yards after contact, Walker possesses the groundwork to be an effective rusher at the next level. Breaking tackles and creating after contact in college translates to the pros extremely well, as seen most recently by Denver Broncos running back Javonte Williams.<br />
<br />
Williams led the nation in missed tackle rate (48%) in his final season at North Carolina and would go on to lead the NFL in the same metric at the conclusion of his stellar rookie season. <br />
<br />
Elusiveness is just one trait Walker has in common with Williams, as both skipped their senior years to enter the draft. Declaring early is a positive sign for a running back in dynasty formats, as they save themselves from another year of wear and tear. <br />
<br />
The lack of work in the passing game is really the only major blemish on Walker's prospect profile because his testing at the NFL scouting combine was also exceptional. He weighed in at 211 pounds and ran a 4.38 40-yard dash (96th percentile).<br />
<br />
"The player I am avoiding is running back Kenneth Walker III. With a rookie draft ADP in the top-3, it's just too steep a price to pay for a running back that is projected to be used heavily on early downs on an offense that easily projects to be bottom-5 in the NFL led by the unsurprising duo of Drew Lock/Geno Smith at quarterback. <br />
<br />
Even if Walker can carve out a first-year workload similar to that of Chris Carson circa 2020 - 16.4 touches per game, 56% snaps share when healthy - it's still going to be a massive uphill battle for him to be a fantasy producer in Year 1.<br />
<br />
Pete Carroll has a stable of backs including Rashaad Penny, Travis Homer and DeeJay Dallas who all figure to work in at some point despite Walker's Round 2 draft capital. <br />
Again, even when Carson was the RB1, he was splitting snaps. <br />
<br />
Penny was brought back on a one-year deal for $5 million (12tth-highest cap hit), Chris Carson - if healthy - is due $6.1 million (10th-highest cap hit) and Homer/Dallas have routinely worked as pass-catchers out of the backfield. <br />
<br />
Seattle also finished dead-last in targets to the RB position last season, creating serious doubt that Walker will be used in that fashion in any capacity as a rookie. Part of that is on Russell Wilson's lack of juice in the screen game, but the offense itself doesn't predicate much RB pass-game usage. Geno Smith posted a meager 12% RB target rate (three per game) in his three starts last season. Drew Lock was at 17%. <br />
<br />
The Seahawks have the chance to be a running back by committee and dumpster fire on offense this season for all the reasons I've laid out, which is why I am adamantly against paying the premium for Walker. If this team falls behind in games, there's no telling which RB will even be on the field. <br />
<br />
I feel so much better about going with one of the many rookie WRs selected in Round 1 ahead of Walker based on his landing spot.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, opportunities should open in this backfield in Year 2 for Walker with Penny likely leaving in free agency. But does he get replaced with another Day 2 running back? Will Seattle's offense even be efficient in 2023 and beyond? So much uncertainty with this entire situation has me hesitant.                                                </div>

The alpha WR falls into the WR3/4 range for redraft purposes. He won't fall as much in best-ball based on the format, but it's hard to imagine drafting Hopkins over Marquise Brown with the six-game suspension baked in.                                                </div>

Unless, of course, you foresaw ex-Chicago Bears passing game coordinator Dave Ragone coming in as the Atlanta Falcons' new offensive coordinator just to install Patterson in a hybrid RB/WR role.<br />
<br />
From Weeks 1-14, fantasy football's RB7 - 15.8 fantasy points per game - was a revelation and a player who changed the tide of leagues as a waiver-wire acquisition.<br />
<br />
Patterson's only issue is that he stumbled across the fantasy football finish line, failing to eclipse more than nine fantasy points or 30 rushing yards in his last four games. The team also used him more in a committee alongside Mike Davis.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, the more bizarre part is that Patterson took a backseat in the receiving game despite his wide receiver background, totaling just seven targets in his final four games after averaging nearly five targets per game. Patterson's 25% target rate per route ranked No. 1 among all running backs.<br />
<br />
Still, even with the poor end to the season, Patterson's best case in free agency was always returning to the Falcons. He is such a specialized talent who needs to be used in a particular manner, which was executed to near perfection under Arthur Smith's tutelage.<br />
<br />
With an overall lack of general playmakers after losing Calvin Ridley and Russell Gage, C-Patt should see a competent role in the Falcons offense. Whether it be as a receiver or rusher (or both), he's a solid bet to lead the backfield with lackluster RB talent on the team vying for touches and targets. <br />
<br />
With Patterson's range of outcomes so wide for fantasy football, he should remain a draft target if his ADP stays in the later rounds. His RB30 ADP on early best-ball is a solid value.<br />
<br />
But I'd be hard-pressed to admit that the Marcus Mariota signing is not ideal for Patterson's fantasy value. Rushing quarterbacks tend to check the ball down less frequently making it less likely Patterson sees less of a consistent target share.<br />
<br />
In Mariota's last stint with the Titans, RBs totaled 4.6 targets per game (17.7% target share). Last year that number was at 8.2 targets per game (26.7% target share).                                                </div>

London concluded the year third in yards per route run (3.52) in his draft class.<br />
<br />
Even if London's final 2022 stat line doesn't turn heads based on potential shoddy quarterback play from Marcus Mariota /Desmond Ridder, a high target share will provide London a solid weekly floor.                                                </div>

He was hyped up after an impressive rookie campaign, but suffered a hamstring injury during training camp that made him unreliable in the starting offense. Through Weeks 1-7, Aiyuk had just one weekly finish inside the top-25. He also averaged an abysmal 0.63 yards per route run - a mark that ranked 98th out of 102 qualifying WRs. Woof. <br />
<br />
But give credit to Aiyuk for turning his season around during the second half. His yards per route run increased substantially (2.16, 13th) and he averaged 13.1 PPR fantasy points per game as the WR24.<br />
<br />
If Aiyuk can roll over his second-half production into 2022, he could end up as a smashing fantasy value in a similar way that Deebo Samuel was viewed in 2021.                                                </div>

<br />
The one game the Packers signal-caller played without his No. 1 receiver in 2021 was his third-worst fantasy finish of the season. And Rodgers' only healthy season-long fantasy finish outside the top-8 came in a season where Adams missed four games. <br />
<br />
The dynamic duo's chemistry was never more apparent in or near the red zone, with Rodgers-Adams combining for 64 touchdowns - double-digits on average - since 2016, 23 more than the next closest duo (Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill). Thirty-three percent of Rodgers touchdowns have gone to Adams over that period. <br />
<br />
Green Bay has bolstered their wide receiver room through free agency and the draft, but it's still improbable that they can make up for Adams' production - especially in the red zone. Without Adams, it's hard to buy Rodgers as a top-12 fantasy quarterback in 2022.                                                </div>

Unsurprisingly, Kirk established career highs across the board in targets (112), receptions (83), and receiving yards (1,035) while filling the void left by an injured DeAndre Hopkins.<br />
<br />
Kirk commanded a 21% target share without Hopkins in the lineup and averaged 13.8 fantasy PPR points per game - a top-10 per-game average. In addition, he finished with the second most receiving yards from the slot among all wide receivers. <br />
<br />
Kirk should stay kicked iside with the Jaguars after they got little production from that position in 2021. Marvin Jones and Laviska Shenault ranked in the bottom 10 with 1.30 yards per route run from the slot. Kirk ranked 13th with 1.80 yards per route run from the slot. He is shaping up to be the new Amari Rodgers for Trevor Lawrence, operating from the inside.<br />
<br />
At worst, Kirk takes shape as a strong WR3 asset who can elevate to WR2 status quickly with an up-and-coming quarterback.                                                </div>

There's a high ceiling for Stevenson, especially if you ask former Patriots linebacker Rob Ninkovich. The ESPN analyst went as far as saying that Stevenson "...will be one of the better, if not one of the top three, running backs in the league based on what I saw with his strength, explosion and catch-and-run ability."                                                </div>

The Jets drafted workhorse running back Breece Hall at the top of the 2nd round, but even considered trading up for him in Round 1 before selecting him 36th overall. The draft capital shows New York's commitment towards Hall being their clear-cut RB1 for 2022 and beyond, which makes Carter nothing more than a hand-cuff. It's a reminder to always sell high on Day 3 running backs that flash as rookies; they can be easily replaced and likely won't "survive" draft after draft without investment from their team.<br />
<br />
Carter's looking anywhere between five-to-eight touches per game with Hall entrenched as the bellcow, making the former UNC back near obsolete as anything other than a backup with some upside. <br />
<br />
From Weeks 7-9 with Tevin Coleman sidelined, Carter averaged 19 touches per game and a 66% snap share. He also finished 10th in yards after contact per attempt (3.4) and third in PFF's elusive rating.<br />
<br />
Carter's receiving ability also fueled four top-17 weekly finishes in 2021, three of which were inside the top-13 in games that featured quarterback checkdown king Mike White under center.                                                </div>

Baby Gronk was the TE7 from that time forward, averaging 11.3 fantasy points per game seventh). He would go on to finish the year as the TE13 overall despite running a route on just 56% of dropbacks.<br />

When starting and healthy, Freiermuth ran a route on 67% of dropbacks - a rate that would have ranked 15th-highest at the position in 2021.

He also led the Falcons with a 29% target share since Week 11 - playing 53% of his snaps for the outside - showcasing his ability to earn passing volume alongside the talented Kyle Pitts<br />
Any receiver in a Tom Brady-led offense should be a sought-after commodity - so consider me in on Gage in 2022. There are plenty of scenarios where Gage continues his success from the tail-end of last season.                                                </div>

<br />
Still, entering his age 30-season fantasy managers should question whether Woods has the juice left to continue producing for fantasy. Often viewed as a safe fantasy WR2 during his time in L.A. - he was WR17 before his injury in 2021 - Woods might be subject to some poor game conditions in the Titans' run-heavy approach that could nuke his weekly fantasy appeal.<br />
<br />
He's got a chance to be the No. 1 receiver if rookie Treylon Burks fails to hit the ground running, but anything less will not be fruitful for the seasoned veteran. <br />
<br />
<br />
Over the past two seasons, production has not been kind to WRs over 30 years old. Only three receivers over 30 - Cole Beasley, Adam Thielen, and Marvin Jones Jr. - finished as top-40 fantasy options. If he stays healthy, Woods could easily beat his ADP. <br />
<br />
But I'm just not sure how high his fantasy ceiling is based on the situation.                                                </div>

But after the 49ers beat reporters butchered the Trey Sermon situation last season and the 49ers' massive investment in Lance last year, I view this situation as an easy buy-low scenario.<br />
<br />
Garoppolo's shoulder surgery is the reason he hasn't been traded. Once he is deemed healthy, I'd presume he gets moved to a QB-needy team or to a roster that sustains an injury at the position.<br />
<br />
Lance only started two games but showed off the rushing that excited fantasy managers during draft season. The 49ers' first-year signal-caller averaged 22.4 expected fantasy points and 60 rushing yards per game.                                                </div>

<br />
Claypool commanded a 27% air yards share on the season and led the team in the metric over the final four weeks. Better days should be ahead of the Notre Dame product if Pittsburgh can get better downfield quarterback play from Kenny Pickett/Mitchell Trubisky. <br />
<br />
Claypool is also due for positive touchdown regression after catching just one of his 12 end-zone targets last season. The 6-foot-5 monster is no stranger to hitting paydirt, after being one of eight wide receivers to score double-digit touchdowns as rookies since 1998. <br />
<br />
However, Claypool's range of outcomes is quite wide heading into his third season with 2022 second-round pick George Pickens, chomping at the bit to be the No. 2 on the offense behind Diontae Johnson.                                                </div>

But Graham's currently a free agent, opening the door for Kmet to smash in 2022. <br />
<br />
Kmet's eighth-ranked route participation and seventh-ranked target share (17%) from 2021 hardly aligns with his fantasy production - no tight end finished with more fantasy points under expectation (-36.6) than the Notre Dame product in 2021.<br />
<br />
That designation is a sign Kmet is due for a fantasy breakout. It signaled as much for guys like Zach Ertz and Dawson Knox, who scored fewer points than expected in 2020 before contributing in fantasy this year. Both tight ends finished 2021 as top-10 options at the position in fantasy points per game.<br />
<br />
The Chicago Bears hired offensive coordinator Luke Getsy to pair with second-year quarterback Justin Fields. Getsy should be able to build an offense more conducive to Fields' mobility - something he had success with at Mississippi State as its former OC.<br />
<br />
An overall offensive boost should help fuel Kmet as 2022's breakout tight end. He has the requisite size and athleticism, sporting an 87th-percentile height, 88th-percentile vertical jump, and 89th-percentile broad jump.<br />
<br />
Kmet checks off all the boxes for a tight end breakout, and that's exactly why I have him ranked three spots ahead of consensus at TE13.                                                </div>

<br />
The tight end/slot receiver hybrid finished sixth in receptions, ninth in receiving yards, fourth in route participation (78%), and fifth in target share (17%) through 18 weeks of action of the 2021 season. This receiving and route volume led to only moderate success in fantasy football, as Mike Gesicki finished as TE9.<br />
<br />
His efficiency metrics left something to be desired, though - he was 13th in fantasy points per game (9.9) and 15th in yards per route run. Part of that does fall on the up-and-down quarterback play, but it just further cements Gesicki as a good, not great tight end in fantasy football. <br />
<br />
My biggest concern is that Gesicki has almost always underwhelmed after the catch - which will likely be a large part of the Dolphins new-look offense. His 3.2 YAC/reception ranked 41st of out 42 qualifying tight ends. <br />
<br />
Gesicki did deliver worthwhile fantasy production at times, as displayed by his TE6 standing from Weeks 3-15 (11.5 fantasy points per game). And 94% of his snaps came lined up in the slot or out wide in 2021, which is another advantage for creating mismatches.<br />
<br />
But all in all, he tends to only rise to the occasion for fantasy purposes when targets become available in the offense because of injuries to other players. <br />
<br />
The athletic tight end will end up meeting his mid-range 2022 ADP/ECR based on his consistent play the past two seasons, but won't enter the top-tier fantasy tight end conversation.                                                </div>

He now has the luxury of throwing to a surplus of offensive weapons including arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL in his old college teammate. <br />
<br />
Let's not forget that when Carr had everybody available last season, the Raiders quarterback ranked second in the NFL in passing yards and 15th in fantasy points per game. However, his ceiling was limited due to his lack of mobility and weaponry; Carr did not finish better than a top-8 quarterback at any point in 2021. <br />
<br />
But Adams figures to provide Carr with a red-zone weapon like no other that will unlock his fantasy ceiling. He's the exact positive touchdown regression that should launch Carr's fantasy numbers. Carr's 3.7 TD rate in 2021 was below his career average (4.3). And his 23 total passing touchdowns were seven below expectation.<br />
<br />
Fully anticipate Carr throwing for 30-plus laser scores bare minimum with Adams at his disposal. Every quarterback last season that threw for at least 30 touchdowns finished inside the top-10 in 2021.                                                </div>

<br />
The former Buccaneer took a major step backward in 2021, being regulated to strict backup duties after losing out on the starting gig in Tampa Bay to Leonard Fournette. And even when loaded to take on the bell-cow role with Fournette sidelined during the end of the season, RoJo failed to fire.<br />
<br />
He earned 20 carries in Week 16 versus the Panthers but totaled just 65 yards. The plodding runner also finished 51st out of 64 qualifying running backs in yards after contact per attempt (2.5).<br />
<br />
Jones is a one-dimensional grinder back, whose fantasy value will be super reliant on carry-volume, offensive line play, and overall offensive efficiency.<br />
<br />
That in itself means he will have fantasy appeal as a late-round running back in redraft if he can carve out a role on early-down and/or at the goal-line in a high-powered Chiefs offense.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">After enjoying a breakout sophomore campaign in 2020 that saw Garrett Wilson earn a 34% dominator rating - which considers the number of touchdowns and receiving yards a player commands within their offense - at 20 years old, the Ohio State product ran it back in impressive fashion in 2021.<br />
<br />
The Buckeye scored 12 receiving touchdowns, compiled over 1,000 receiving yards and generated the FBS' 12th-highest passer rating when targeted (141.7). <br />
<br />
He also proved to NFL teams that he was more than just a shifty slot receiver, averaging 3.00 yards per route run despite operating on the outside on 83% of his routes run, which nearly matched his same yards per route run average from 2020 when he spent most of his time inside. <br />
<br />
And although Wilson's 2021 24% dominator rating was less than his sophomore campaign, that's really due to Ohio State's talent in the wide receiver room. He was competing for targets with senior Chris Olave and sophomore standout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who led the nation in PFF receiving grade (91.7). <br />
<br />
Going beyond the box score reveals that Wilson is a versatile route runner who can align anywhere on the field and still win.<br />
<br />
He was selected by the New York Jets 10th overall and joins a somewhat crowded WR room. And nobody can be sure Zach Wilson can support one or multiple fantasy assets. There are definitely question marks.<br />
<br />
However, Wilson is worth betting on because he's shown the ability at Ohio State to command targets and produce in an offense littered with other elite talents. Doesn't hurt his chance that he was deemed open on 84% of his targets last season.                                                </div>

The former undrafted free agent has been the Patriots target leader for the past two seasons, with his most recent accomplishment finishing top-12 in target share (23%) in 2021.<br />
<br />
The high-end target share also aligned with Meyer's deployment in the Patriots passing attack, where Meyers was running a route on 92% of team dropbacks - the sixth-highest mark in the league.<br />
<br />
New England's No. 1 receiver just needs to cash-in on more touchdowns to unlock his fantasy ceiling. He has been extremely underused in that category; his 866 receiving yards resulting in two touchdowns were the lowest of any WR in 2021.                                                </div>

Los Angeles would likely turn to Hendo as their pseudo-workhorse if Akers suffers another injury in 2022. And he's likely to be productive based on this projected three-down volume and beneficial offensive environment. <br />

Just be wary that Henderson may not offer the tantalizing league-winning upside based on his own inability to stay healthy throughout his NFL career. He's never started more than 11 games in a season and is already dealing with a soft tissue injury in OTAs.                                                </div>

<br />
The 2018 third-rounder averaged just 10.2 fantasy points per game in 2021 (47th), less than his 2020 season (10.8).<br />
<br />
It \doesn't help Gallup's case either that the team re-signed tight end Dalton Schultz, who figures to compete for top targets with CeeDee Lamb. Third-round rookie Jalen Tolbert also figures to get plenty of reps in training camp with Gallup rehabbing. <br />
<br />
Be careful to not overinvest in Gallup for fear that you'll be wasting a roster spot for a player that falls into the fantasy WR3 with upside tier, that just doesn't move the needle.                                                </div>

The Bengals slot receiver commanded just a 15% target share and target rate per route run.<br />
<br />
The target rate per route ranked dead-last among 73 qualifying players last season that commanded at least 100 targets. <br />
<br />
It's clear that Boyd can't be viewed as much working as a clear ancillary piece of the Cincinnati passing attack. Tight end C.J. Uzomah's departure does open up the potential that Boyd could shoulder a larger target workload, but his upside remains extremely limited while Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are healthy.                                                </div>

Long-time general manager Mickey Loomis has had zero issues spending high-end draft capital on WRs in the past, so it's not surprising the Saints traded up to draft Chris Olave at No. 11.<br />
The former Buckeye doesn't offer the same skill set as Thomas, but he can separate from defenders at an elite level downfield. Olave wrapped up his 2021 season in the 96th percentile in separation versus single coverage and caught seven touchdowns on throws of 20-plus air yards.<br />
Olave draws parallels to Calvin Ridley with his impressive route running ability. But like Ridley coming out of school, Olave doesn't offer much after the catch.<br />
His forced broken and missed tackle rate ranked 43rd among 43 qualifying wide receivers in the class. His yards after the catch per reception (4.2) ranked 37th.<br />
Without much YAC-ability in an offense that ranked fifth in that YAC/reception last season and a firm seat in the WR2 chair behind a healthy Thomas, I have trouble getting overly excited for Olave in New Orleans as nothing more than a boom-or-bust WR4.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Jarvis Landry signed with the New Orleans Saints this offseason, providing much added depth to the team's wide receiver room. <br />
<br />
The 29-year-old's best season with the Browns came back in 2019 when he averaged 12.2 fantasy points per game in half-point scoring as the WR13. The former LSU star's production fell off in the last two seasons amid quarterback Baker Mayfield's struggles.<br />
<br />
However, Landry displayed a higher fantasy ceiling in games that Odell Beckham Jr. missed from 2020-2021 averaging 11.2 points per game in 2020 (nine games) and 9.5 points per game in 2021 (ten games).<br />
<br />
So although his WR56 and 8.9 fantasy points per game in 2021 suggest Landry may be on the decline, he was more a victim of bad circumstances. His 25% target rate per route run ranked top-12 last season - tying him with the likes of D.J. Moore, D.K. Metcalf, Brandin Cooks and Stefon Diggs.<br />
<br />
He'll compete for his fair share of targets in an offense alongside what now appears like a sneaky good pass-catching corps between veteran Michael Thomas, first-round rookie Chris Olave and running back Alvin Kamara.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a clear path for steady fantasy WR2 production with Landry if Thomas doesn't overcome the remaining hurdles stemming from his ankle rehab.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">James Robinson operated as the pseudo bellcow for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021 after Travis Etienne went down with a preseason injury. He posted inconsistent fantasy production as the RB24 overall and in points per game in 14 games amid horrible usage deployed by the 2021 Jags coaching staff. <br />
<br />
His touches varied from 21-to-2 depending on the week, so he was nearly impossible to project in fantasy. It's possible that 2022 presents a similar issue with Robinson as Etienne makes his professional debut. <br />
<br />
But JRob does deserve credit for maintaining efficient play whenever he got opportunities last season, finishing 11th in yards after contact per attempt (3.3) and 8th in red-zone touchdowns (8). <br />
<br />
His real hurdle for fantasy relevance besides fending off a 2022 first-round running back is attempting a speedy recovery from a torn Achilles suffered in late December. He will be unable to participate in OTAs, while his backfield counterpart is full-go as the team installs the new-look Doug Pederson offense. The former undrafted free agent is not guaranteed to be ready for Week 1. <br />
<br />
It's hard to envision Robinson being anything more than a speculative zero-RB target, with hopes that he can recapture 2020 form if given the volume. However, Pederson's track record of deploying a multitude of backs does make it seem like Robinson will be a 1B to Etienne's 1A, with his clearest path to fantasy relevance coming through goal-line opportunities.                                                </div>

We have an extremely large sample size of Golladay catching touchdowns at the NFL level, though - he led the NFL with 11 receiving touchdowns in 2019. So the big-bodied wideout has nowhere to go but up in 2022.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Somebody on the Miami Dolphins is in for a rude awakening come September. Mike Gesicki, Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill are all being pushed up the rankings/draft boards with hopes that Tua Tagovailoa takes a massive step forward in Year 3 under first-year head coach Mike McDaniel.<br />
<br />
I am not as optimistic that Tagovailoa can be the vehicle to deliver fantasy goodness to all these pieces in South Beach because this offense is going to be run-heavy. McDaniel made his way up the coaching ranks under Kyle Shanahan as a standout run-game coordinator. And should he follow in the footsteps of Shanahan as the offensive mastermind in Miami, fantasy managers should expect a lot of rushing and YAC schemes.<br />
<br />
49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo ranked 29th in aDOT in 2021 (7.6) after ranking 39th and 35th in the category the two years prior.  Tagovailoa's aDOT was 34th in the league (7.6) in 2021. <br />
<br />
Jimmy G's most productive seasons have seen him average just north of 16 fantasy points per game - good for QB17 in 2021. Tagovailoa has yet to eclipse 14 fantasy points per game two years into his career. He also ranked 31st in throwing at the intermediate level (62.5 PFF grade) among 37 qualifying passers last season.<br />
<br />
So although Tua is viewed as a popular late-round quarterback among fantasy circles, I have to admit I won't be pulling the trigger on him in 1QB redraft formats. Especially with his brutal early schedule. New England, Baltimore and Buffalo are hardly the stream-worthy spots you will be confident in starting the southpaw QB. In the Dolphins quarterback's four combined starts versus those teams in 2021, his fantasy finishes were QB23, QB24, QB18 and QB16.                                                </div>

He averaged 12.9 expected fantasy points per game through 17 weeks (28th). <br />
<br />
His acquisition by the Patriots helps shore up the need for a big-bodied wide receiver on the perimeter that can make plays downfield. But the extent of how high a target share Parker will command remains to be seen. If anything, he probably has the most touchdown upside of the New England Patriots WRs.<br />
<br />
Just don't be overly bullish on him being available all season-long, as his injury history proceeds him. His 1.48 yards per route run was also his worst mark since 2018 as was his 55% catch rate.                                                </div>

But don't forget that a washed-up Cam Newton went from irrelevant to a top-12 ranked QB in one week last year because of rushing production. <br />
<br />
Fields finished as a top-12 fantasy quarterback in his last four full games in 2021, averaging 21.7 fantasy points per game. He also averaged 56 rushing yards per game over his last six. All in all, Fields averaged 35 rushing yards per game during his rookie season. The last three rookie QBs to do so? Newton, Josh Allen and Robert Griffin III. They all finished as top-12 fantasy quarterbacks in their second seasons, with the two former QBs finishing top-6. <br />
<br />
It won't take long for the narrative to spin on the talented Fields after he starts the season hot out of the gates. Five of the Bears' first six matchups are against secondaries that are the weak part of their respective defense, lost talent in free agency and/or are unproven. In Week 1, Fields takes on the 49ers. He rushed for over 100 yards against them last season.                                                </div>

It's a three-year deal worth up to $36 million. Essentially the same money that Russell Gage got from the Buccaneers and what Zay Jones got from Jacksonville.<br />
<br />
The ex-Packers field stretcher has ranked inside the top-5 in yards per reception over the last two seasons, so he will feel right at home catching bombs from Patrick Mahomes. <br />
<br />
He is sure to experience spiked weeks of production attached to the Chiefs' big-armed quarterback, but valuing him more than a weekly boom-or-bust fantasy WR3/4 would be malpractice. <br />
<br />
MVS does get a bump up in the WR rankings with a slight upgrade at QB and the opportunity to see a larger target share, but I wouldn't view him too dissimilarly to how he was perceived in Green Bay for the past four seasons. He has never commanded 75 targets in a season.<br />
<br />
His 2022 wide receiver ranking is comfortably behind JuJu Smith-Schuster and Skyy Moore.                                                </div>

But Moore has a chance to hit the ground running in the post-Tyreek Hill era, competing for targets with fellow newcomers Juju Smith Schuster and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. His impressive YAC ability - tied for first with 26 forced missed tackles in 2021 - and ability to play both inside/outside helps him stand out from the other Chiefs WRs. With Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback, Moore could smash his current ECR into the stratosphere. It's not that outlandish to think a second-rounder can make an immediate impact considering six of the 12 highest-scoring Round 1 & 2 rookie WRs selected since 2017 were second-rounders.                                                </div>

The Memphis product finished sixth in yards per route run, hauling in 38 of his 50 targets for 302 receiving yards. And in 5 games where he played at least 35% of the snaps, Gainwell averaged 17.5 fantasy points (PPR) and 4.2 catches per game on just 12.4 touches per contest. <br />
<br />
Among the Eagles' crowded backfield, Gainwell playing on third downs as the primary pass-catcher provide him weekly standalone value. But there's always a chance he eats more into work on early downs and in the red zone entering Year 2. <br />
<br />
The team's leader in red-zone touches from last season (Jordan Howard, 24) is no longer on the roster. Gainwell scored five touchdowns from inside the 20-yard line last season.                                                </div>

<br />
Isaiah Spiller represents the latest rehash of the Chargers trying to find an appropriate thunder to Austin Ekeler's lightning, and I for one think Spiller is already the best bet currently on the roster. The former Texas A&M running back has the capacity for three-down spot start duties with an all-encompassing skill set and desirable size - 6-feet and 217 pounds .<br />
<br />
Spiller should be a solid producer for the Chargers if given the opportunity although his lack of top-notch speed could keep him from being elite. He had only eight carries of 20-plus yards in 2021.<br />
<br />
But I'd be hard-pressed to ignore his impressive age-adjusted production as one of his most encouraging traits. Since Day 1 at Texas A&M, Spiller has been the lead dog for the Aggies.<br />
<br />
As a true freshman in 2019, he scored 10 rushing touchdowns and finished 16th in the nation in yards after contact per attempt en route to a 22% dominator rating.<br />
<br />
The power running back capped off his first year in impressive fashion with back-to-back seasons of 1,000 rushing yards and 100 missed tackles. Spiller also displayed receiving prowess, commanding at least an 8% target share and an average of 25 receptions per season.<br />
<br />
With Justin Jackson still an unsigned free agent, Spiller looks slated for instant impact in Year 1.                                                </div>

During Chark's fantasy WR17 season in 2019, he ranked sixth in the NFL in catches of 20-plus air yards (13) before his injury. Goff has averaged 13 completions of 20-plus air yards the last two seasons.<br />
<br />
Chark screams like he will be used more like a vertical field stretcher decoy that will open up targets for St. Brown, running backs, and tight ends underneath.                                                </div>

<br />
Don't be too quick to forget that Tonyan caught 11 touchdowns in 2020, and there are many red-zone opportunities left with Adams removed from the equation. The new Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver has earned 28 red-zone targets over the last two seasons - most by any player.<br />
<br />
As long as Tonyan remains just outside the middle-range tight end ADP, he is definitely worth an 11th or 12th round selection. With so much ambiguity regarding which wide receiver will emerge from Green Bay, the right answer might be just drafting Tonyan instead.                                                </div>

<br />
There's a chance that PFF's highest-graded running back from the FBS (92.0) in 2021 carves out a role on early downs even though the team added Marlon Mack this offseason. News flash, people - Mack signed a one-year, $two-million deal with Houston, and it's less than the team is paying Rex Burkhead..1 million of Burkhead's $2.35 million contract is fully guaranteed.<br />
<br />
We could easily see Mack released as much as we could see Pierce become the team's starting running back.<br />
<br />
Although my one reservation with Pierce is that traditionally New England has been very stingy about featuring rookie running backs historically - especially ones drafted late. During Nick Caserio's tenure with the Patriots, Stevan Ridley's 87 carries were the most for any non-first-round rookie running back.<br />
<br />
It was until Caserio left New England for Houston, that Rhamondre Stevenson broke that mark with 133 carries in 2021.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, there's clearly an affinity with veteran running backs that Texans can't seem to quit. They force-fed David Johnson and Mark Ingram II among other veterans last season, despite having some younger players they could give reps to.<br />
<br />
Caserio's post-draft press conference cited Pierce as someone that needs to earn a role and be a factor on special teams. So pump the brakes on Pierce RB1 szn ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
The fact Pierce never fully took over Florida's backfield does raise red flags. His 12% career dominator rating is eerily similar to Trey Sermon (12%) from last season, and Sermon struggled to separate himself from the pack in his rookie campaign. <br />
<br />
Even during his breakout senior season, the 5-foot-10 and 218-pound running back earned just a 22% dominator rating while sharing the backfield alongside fellow draft-eligible running back Malik Davis.<br />
<br />
However, I am willing to offer some benefit of the doubt after Pierce never topped 106 carries in college.<br />
<br />
There may have been some underlying issue with former Gators head coach Dan Mullen that prevented Pierce from seeing a more featured role. Case in point: Pierce only had two games with double-digit carries in 2021, both of which came after Mullen was fired toward the end of the season. <br />
<br />
Pierce's lackluster dominator rating doesn't capture his coach's potential ineptitude. The fact Pierce competed with NFL talent like Jordan Scarlett and La'Mical Perine very early in his college career paints a better picture of how his impact will be felt in years to come. But from the get-go, I doubt we see Pierce be a major fantasy factor to start the 2022 season.                                                </div>

The Jags quarterback finished with the same expected fantasy points per game average as Burrow in 2021 (17.3) but underwhelmed tremendously in a poor situation. His -72.3 fantasy points versus expectation were the most of any QB in 2021.  <br />
<br />
Lawrence posted a season-high 85.1 PFF passing grade in the season-finale, offering some hope that he can turn things around in 2022 with a new coaching staff in place.<br />
<br />
There's a strong chance that Jacksonville dials up the passing attempts with Doug Pederson calling the shots on offense. During his five-year tenure in Philadelphia, only once did the offense not finish top-10 in pass attempts.                                                </div>

<br />
Considering Higbee is always on the field in LA's one-TE offense - 93% route participation the Divisonal round, 76% during 2021 - he will have productive outings in the confines of a high-powered offense. <br />
<br />
He should be good to go by Week 1, barring any setbacks from his knee surgery.                                                </div>

His production the last two seasons earned him a three-year, $34.5 million contract extension. Like it or not, Patrick will be on the field as much - if not more - than Jeudy in 2022 as the boundary receiver opposite Courtland Sutton.

The ex-Rams tight end ranked as the TE9 in fantasy points per game (PPR) from Weeks 10-16 while running a route on 74% of dropbacks.<br />
<br />
Everett proved he can be a featured No. 1 tight end for the Chargers coming off a career year. He achieved career-highs in receptions (48) and receiving yards (478) and wreaked havoc with the ball in his hands, forcing 11 missed tackles after the catch - sixth-most among tight ends.<br />
<br />
His peripheral metrics in Seattle's offense - 12% target share, 63% route participation and 17% target rate per route run - were nearly identical to Jared Cook on the Chargers offense last season.<br />
<br />
Cook finished as TE16 overall which seems like Everett's fantasy floor heading into 2022. The tackle-breaking tight end finished the 2021 season just .4 points per game short of Cook's average (8.3 versus 7.9) despite playing in an offense that ranked dead last in pass attempts per game (29.1). <br />
<br />
L.A. ranked third in that category last season (39.6). <br />
<br />
Breakout tight ends are generally athletic players who earn above-average route participation in high-powered offenses. Everett fits the profile of next season's star at the position.                                                </div>

I'd don't think this is a result of the team drafting Cole Turner in Round 5 and more of an acknowledgment of Thomas' return from a least-season ACL injury. Chances are he misses the first few weeks of the season. But similar to the case with OBJ, he can be a force for you down the stretch when healthy.<br />
<br />
Thomas figures to be back in the starting role after signing an extension last season. I'd buy low on him across the board coming off his injury-plagued season, which limited him to just five full games. The Washington tight end role features a 90%-plus route run per dropback rate, which is extremely rare to find among NFL offenses.                                                </div>

The former Rams running back performed admirably in relief of Darrell Henderson Jr., but he was immediately supplanted by Cam Akers once the second-year back was deemed healthy enough to play a full-time role.<br />
He signed a 1 year, $1.75M contract with the Miami Dolphins this offseason, joining a backfield with Chase Edmonds and Raheem Mostert. Michel offers the least explosiveness of the bunch but has the most proven track record of shouldering a workload that translates into fantasy production at 5-foot-11 and 216 pounds. <br />
<br />
Considering neither Edmonds nor Mostert (entering age 30-season) have ever commanded a consistent three-down workload, Michel has super interesting appeal if he becomes the No. 1 runner in the Miami backfield. Don't rule it out despite his very mediocre one-year contract.                                                </div>

<br />
Goff's average depth of throw has decreased over the last four seasons, with his most recent 2021 mark (6.8) ranking dead last among 38th qualifying quarterbacks. He has also averaged just 13 completions of 20-plus air yards the last two seasons. Williams finished top-seven among all college wide receivers in receiving yards on 20-plus air yard throws in 2021.<br />
<br />
However, Williams does also possess top-tier YAC-ability so he should be able to salvage some production when he returns from injury. <br />
<br />
And although Goff's lack of deep game isn't ideal, we have seen him fuel top fantasy WR seasons before in Los Angeles and Detroit. Most recently with Amon-Ra St. Brown, who was the fantasy WR3 to close out last season. Williams commanded a 31% dominator rating last season by hanging 1,561 receiving yards, 20 yards per reception and 15 touchdowns - all achievements that ranked top-three among his 2022 NFL Draft class.<br />
<br />
Nobody will be shocked to see Williams out-produce the combination of St. Brown and T.J. Hockenson once he is fully acclimated into the offense.                                                </div>

But with coming off a torn ACL and J.K. Dobbins entrenched as the 1A starter in the Ravens backfield, is the efficient GusBu even worth the squeezer in fantasy football?<br />
<br />
Consider in his best season, 2021, Edwards finished RB35 in 0.5 PPR scoring. That low-end RB3 upside is gone now. He can't be viewed as much of anything but a hand-cuff to Dobbins, with hopes that he can also occasionally find the end zone to make up for a lack of pass-game work. Because ten touches per game in the form of carries is going to do literally nothing to help your fantasy lineup. Do not buy into the fallacy that Edwards owns "stand-alone value."                                                </div>

<br />
Former teammate Patrick Mahomes vouched for Williams, informing Arizona that he was a back he both liked/trusted. Williams posted 1,000 yards from scrimmage, scored 8 TDs and had zero fumbles on 191 touches in 2021.<br />
<br />
He also proved that he could shoulder the load with Clyde Edwards-Helaire sidelined with injury. In the six games that Williams was the clear-cut starter in the Chiefs backfield, he averaged 19 fantasy points per game (PPR) on 18.3 touches per game. Also averaged nearly 100 yards from scrimmage (96.3). <br />
<br />
Williams is the James Conner backup to target across all formats, as he'd likely inherit the RB1 role should the injury-prone starter go down. His body of work as a receiver and goal-line back present him immediate fantasy RB1 upside. <br />
<br />
The former UDFA led the Chiefs backfield in red-zone touches and averaged 4.5 receptions per game as the starter in 2021. His 47 catches overall ranked ninth.                                                </div>

David Montgomery is on the final year of his rookie contract, and the new coaching regime will have no loyalty toward him.

Herbert was PFF's fourth-highest-graded rusher (84.6) from Weeks 5-8 with Montgomery sidelined. The rookie rushed for at least 72 yards in all four games. Montgomery rushed for 72 yards four times all season.                                                </div>

And he hasn't disappointed due to a lack of opportunities, either. He finished top-15 in route participation (68%) and had almost zero competition for targets with injuries to Kenny Golladay, Kadarius Toney and Sterling Shepard.<br />
Alas, Engram failed to command any worthwhile target share with his abysmal 14% target rate per route run. So consider me slightly hesitant to buy into Engram breaking out in 2022 because his new head coach has a history of featuring tight ends. Sure, it works in Engram's favor, but last I checked Dan Arnold is still on the team. And Doug Pederson has also been known to heavily feature two tight ends in his offense, which doesn't always translate to fantasy success.                                                </div>

Jefferson finished 20th in route participation (86%) and should maintain that high-end usage heading into the 2022 season. In that role last season, Jefferson finished as WR35 overall on the season and outside the top 40 in points per game.<br />

We could easily see Mack released as much as we could see him become the team's starting running back.

<br />
The Chiefs adding a plethora of WRs in free agency along with second-rounder Skyy Moore in the NFL Draft hints they aren't expecting a massive leap for Hardman. <br />
<br />
My advice is to not get overly aggressive drafting a player that has yet to rid the role of a gadget player since entering the league. Because although the thought of a speedy wide receiver attached to Patrick Mahomes is enticing the on-field production really has not been there for Hardman even from a spiked-weeked perspective.<br />
<br />
Case in point, he has finished a a top-18 weekly WR in PPR once in three years to go along with a handful of 18-20th overall finishes.                                                </div>

But with his health status off the Achilles tear a major concern and the Giants featuring highly-competitive wide receiver room, 2022 might be the year Ol' Shepard falls to the wayside as nothing more than bench depth with a decent floor in PPR formats as his main selling argument.                                                </div>

The elite athleticism and big-play ability present a sky-high ceiling as Aaron Rodgers' future WR1, but a lack of refinement and focus drops reveal a somewhat scary floor.<br />
<br />
MVS' 73-target rookie season in 2018 is the most a first-year WR has ever earned from Rodgers, which further bolsters the case for a Valdes-Scantling floor for Watson. Davante Adams led that team with 169 targets. <br />
<br />
Either way, he's worth a middle-to-backend Round 1 pick in rookie drafts. The opportunity he could see from Day 1 amid a lackluster receiving corps of Sammy Watkins, Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb and Amari Rodgers is salivating.                                                </div>

The Atlanta Falcons' fifth-round running back ranks 1st in rushing yards after contact (1,847), 2nd in rushing touchdowns (36) 3rd in PFF rushing grade (94.8) among FBS players with at least 150 carries over the past two seasons.<br />
<br />
I believe he would have been taken by Atlanta in Round 4 if they had a pick available to them, so I don't think it's fair to view the RBs that went in Round 4 in a higher regard.<br />
<br />
I also don't think it's outlandish to think that he's already the best pure rusher among a backfield that consists of Cordarelle Patterson, Damien Williams and Qadree Ollison. He's proven to be able to shoulder a massive workload as both a rusher and receiver, which is not true of any other back for the Dirty Birds.                                                </div>

Atlanta traded Matt Ryan to the Colts for a 2022 third-round pick. <br />
It's a major upgrade for Ryan's fantasy appeal that he was able to get out of Atlanta - a franchise that looks to be in a massive rebuild. Last season, Ryan lacked a strong supporting cast which contributed to his lackluster numbers. <br />
Calvin Ridley played five games, and the Falcons owned the league's second-worst blocking offensive line per PFF. Ryan faced pressure at the sixth-highest rate (40%). <br />
That won't be the case in Indianapolis with a better offensive line in place, a stable running game, and playmakers like Michael Pittman Jr. and Jonathan Taylor to boot.<br />
Ryan was also vastly underrated as a passer despite the ongoing turmoil ranking above average in many of PFF's sticky efficiency metrics in 2021: 12th in PFF passing grade from a clean pocket, second throwing at the intermediate level, and ninth throwing on early downs.<br />
Entering a Frank Reich system that prides itself on churning out play-action (5th) and screen passes (10th) will make Ryan's life a helluva lot easier than it was in Atlanta.<br />
Ryan ranked 33rd in screen throw rate and 12th in play-action rate in 2021. The new Colts quarterback is back on the fantasy QB2 radar for 2022.                                                </div>

Playing in a super pass-heavy offense will allow Crowder the opporuntity to soak up targets underneath, as he has done when healthy for the New York Jets. Just last year, the 29-year old commanded at least five targets in every single game he played without leaving due to injury. <br />
<br />
In those ten healthy games, the slot receiver averaged nearly five receptions and seven targets per game.                                                </div>

Brown's absurd efficiency and YAC-ability in Tennessee was a primary driving force behind Ryan Tannehill's fantasy success as a Titan. Even with Treylon Burks in the fold, it's hard to get overly excited about the Tennessee QB in one of the NFL's most run-heavy offenses devoid of any elite, proven pass-catchers. He got exposed without offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and weapons last season in 2021, finishing the season with his lowest passer rating to date as a Titan (88.1, 23rd). Tannehill's passer rating off play action throws also fell off (96.1 versus 109.5). 2022 is going to be a rude awakening for Tannehill, who has the largest cap hit in the NFL this year ($38.6M).                                                </div>

<br />
White has shades of David Johnson and Le'Veon Bell in his style of play, which clearly didn't go unnoticed by the new senior football consultant for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bruce Arians.<br />
<br />
The Arizona State product ranked first in his class in receiving yards, No. 1 in yards per route run (2.24) and second in receptions (43). <br />
<br />
His 16% target share is absolutely bonkers for a running back at the college level, and it did wonders to generate his third-round draft capital.<br />
<br />
The same sentiment can be made for White's 31% dominator rating and 3.33 offensive yards per snap over the past two seasons. Both would have ranked in the top three in last year's class.<br />
<br />
His yards per snap and PFF receiving grade also both rank first among the class. White's career receiving grade was superior to anybody from last year's class as well.<br />
<br />
After a strong showing at Senior Bowl week - PFF's highest-graded rusher (74.9) - and at the NFL combine - and NFL Combine performance - 38-inch vertical jump (86th percentile), 125-inch broad jump (87th percentile) - White has league-winning potential if given the opportunity in the Buccaneers offense.                                                </div>

The Browns also released Austin Hooper, which should open up the opportunity for the athletic Njoku to take a major leap. Don't be too quick to forget that Njoku already as a top-10 TE finish on his career resume.                                                </div>

Hubbard finished as the RB36 last season with five top-24 weekly finishes in a featured role.<br />
Although, I give the slight edge to Foreman over Hubbard as the favorite to emerge as the clear-cut CMC handcuff after how strong he finished the 2021 season. From Weeks 12 through the Divisonal Round he averaged over 78 rushing yards and 12.1 fantasy points per game (RB17).                                                </div>

But his efficiency was horrible in the disaster that was the Jags in 2021; he averaged just 9.9 points per game. Good for WR51. Woof.<br />
<br />
Entering his age-32 season it remains to be seen whether Jones can keep up his steady production in a brand new offense with new pieces littered throughout. However, the fact that he will be starter on the outside in a pass-happy offense is not being considered enough in his WR78 ADP. <br />
<br />
He's hardly a breakout candidate by any means, but his 120 targets and 19% target share from Trevor Lawrence last season due lend some credence that he's priced at his absolute floor, with WR3 range very realistic with his projected full-time role. <br />
<br />
His 17 end-zone targets last season ranked fourth-most among all players in 2021.                                                </div>

It's music to the ears of fantasy drafters looking for a late-round quarterback with upside, because Jones has the skill set to be that player in a better offensive environment.<br />
Before a Week 5 concussion, Jones was the QB8 overall and in points per game (23.3). The Giants quarterback ranked third in rushing yards per game (47/game) and second in PFF passing grade. <br />
<br />
This offseason, New York drafted the best offensive tackle in the draft with the selection of Evan Neal at No. 7 overall. It provides Jones the protection he desperately needs as he looks to prove to the New York organization that he is worthy of being the long-term answer at quarterback.<br />
<br />
With the Giants upgrading their entire offensive line through free agency and the draft, Jones is back on the fantasy QB2 radar in Superflex formats. Recall that last season he was playing behind PFF's third-worst graded offensive line.<br />
<br />
He will also benefit greatly from the No.1-easiest strength of schedule for QBs.                                                </div>

I absolutely love the fit for Pickens here with the Steelers, who seem to never miss selecting wideouts on Day 2.<br />
<br />
Injuries and off-field issues plagued Pickens' draft stock, but he looks fully healthy based on his testing at the NFL Combine. And Pittsburgh seems like the right spot for him to get his head on straight.<br />
<br />
I already can't wait for the heated training camp fights between him and Chase Claypool as the gloves come off - well not really - for target supremacy.<br />
<br />
Pickens' college profile screams that of a true alpha, so I'd be looking to stash him across the board before he is fully unleashed. <br />

The Georgia Bulldog WR broke out as a true 18-year old freshman, finishing 2019 as PFF's the 17th-highest-graded receiver in the nation (88.0) - ahead of future NFL wideouts like Jerry Jeudy, Justin Jefferson, Devonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle.                                                </div>

<br />
After such an impressive first season in New England, it wouldn't be outlandish to see Bourne earn more targets in Year 2. After all, his 70% route participation has room to grow.                                                </div>

The Browns understand his limitations as an athlete, but his strengths as an underneath wide receiver can help him produce after the catch.<br />
<br />
Bell finished third in the FBS in receiving yards on the outside (1,097), second in total forced missed tackles (25) and 10th in PFF receiving grade (86.9) among his draft class.<br />
<br />
He's a perfect fit alongside prototypical No. 1 WR Amari Cooper and the speedy duo of Donovan Peoples-Jones/Anthony Schwartz.                                                </div>

During his last season of play, Watson led the NFL in passing yards and yards per attempt (8.9).<br />
<br />
Just be wary that a 4-8 game suspension will likely be coming down for Watson. However, that would not shy me away from him or any of his teammates because fantasy leagues - both redraft and best ball tournaments - are won in November/December, not September.                                                </div>

Case in point: Beckham owned the second-worst catchable target rate in the league since joining the Cleveland Browns. Of course, his numbers weren't great.<br />
<br />
But as a Ram, Beckham was PFF's 33rd-graded wide receiver (72.2), averaging a 19% target share and 12.4 fantasy points per game from Week 12 through the divisional round. OBJ had his best game with the Rams in the NFC title game, hauling in nine of 11 targets for 113 receiving yards (24% target share). <br />
<br />
And he looked well on his way to another massive game in the Super Bowl after catching two passes for 52 yards and one score in the first half alone. Unfortunately for Beckham, he tore his ACL - tanking his free agency stock and putting his entire 2022 season in doubt. <br />
<br />
It's reported that OBJ will re-sign with the Rams or the Packers, which will significantly impact where his ADP ultimately rests at.                                                </div>

The former Falcon is in sole possession of C.J. Uzomah's vacated role from last season offers some fantasy appeal.<br />
<br />
Uzomah's 78% route participation ranked fourth-highest among tight ends in 2021<br />
<br />
Every-down tight ends on the field that often in high-scoring environments will stumble into fantasy scoring. It's a highly coveted role primed to ooze fantasy points. However, being on the field doesn't always translate to the requisite fantasy production especially in offenses loaded with other weapons. Uzomah's 13% target rate per route run ranked last among tight ends with at least 40 targets in 2021. Hurst's 15% target rate wasn't much better.<br />
<br />
It doesn't exactly inspire confidence that Hurst is the clear-cut late-round tight end to target in 2022, but he is well worth targeting late in drafts. Hurst is just one year removed from a TE9 overall finish in 2020.                                                </div>

It's possible Succop's just not that good after finishing with the 25th-ranked FG% in 2021 (83.3%). He also doesn't have the leg strength to nail longer field goals with just 2 50-plus yard kicks converted over the last 3 seasons.                                                </div>

Because based on the outlook of the Falcons offense -- not great, 24th in RZ efficiency last season -- we should be ranking/drafting him more like he was last season. He was the K18.<br />
Admittedly though, I'd expect Koo to regress positively closer to his 2020 form after finishing the season as PFF's second-highest graded kicker with the 5th best FG% (93%). Doesn't hurt either that he plays predominately in a dome.                                                </div>

After throwing one TD pass over a five-game midseason stretch in 2021, Goff threw 11 TD passes over his final five games, buoyed by the emergence of WR Amon-Ra St. Brown. It's easy to forget that Goff had a pair of top-12 fantasy finishes with the Rams earlier in his career. The QB1 upside may be gone, but Goff's late-2021 competence and his cache of young weapons at least makes him worthy of consideration in superflex leagues.                                                </div>

<br />
Jordan also dominated the receiving usage over the team's last two games, running 40 routes to Pharaoh Brown's 18 and Anthony Auclair's five. It's a great sign that Jordan should lock down the primary receiving role at tight end in Houston, especially with Jordan Akins signing with the New York Giants this offseason.<br />
<br />
It's easy to envision Jordan carving out a solid receiving role in a lackluster/unproven receiving corps behind Cooks. He's an athletic tight end with YAC-ability that I will gladly draft as my second or third tight end across any squad.                                                </div>

Considering the same can't be said for guys like Kadarius Toney or any other leftover Giants skill players from the previous regime, we could see Robinson step in Day 1 and offer an immediate impact. <br />
<br />
I'm also more optimistic than most that Brian Daboll understands how to use a shorter receiver like Robinson, based on his prior experiences with Cole Beasley and Isaiah McKenzie in Buffalo. And the Giants don't seem overly concerned about listing him at 5-foot-11 after he measured at 5-foot-8 at the NFL Scouting Combine. Go figure. <br />
<br />
In his first season playing wide receiver, Robinson finished second in the FBS in yards per route run (3.56). The Kentucky product also owns PFF's No. 1 career receiving grade (93.4) in the 2022 draft class.                                                </div>

Pierce figures to slide-into that vertical field-stretching role for the Colts vacated by veteran T.Y. Hilton based on the rookie's speed and vertical profile from his college career at Cincinnati. But how valuable of a role is that with the team committed to both Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman Jr. as the clear touch hogs of the offense. Not to mention, Ryan's deep ball rate (9.1%) ranked 32nd out of 38 qualifying quarterbacks in 2021.                                                </div>

He is certainly capable of being more than a third-stringer after an extremely impressive 2021 campaign that saw him finish as PFF's highest-graded rusher (90.6). <br />
<br />
Johnson also delivered in his three starts, averaging a whopping 22.6 fantasy points per game. He's a great player to target late with the hope that he finds more opportunity in 2022. <br />
<br />
Kareem Hunt's contract ends at the end of the 2022 season, so the Browns could move on from him a year early with a mid-year trade and elevate Johnson to the No. 2 on the depth chart.                                                </div>

The former Alabama wide receiver caught 96 balls for over 1,100 receiving yards and eight touchdowns in his final junior season. He just happened to be overshadowed by Ohio State transfer Jameson Williams.<br />
<br />
But don't sleep on Metchie because he possesses a nice skillset that will translate well with the Texans. He's a savvy route runner that understands how to get leverage and create separation from defenders. His game reminds me of Eddie Royal.<br />
<br />
He probably won't ever be a true No. 1, but that doesn't preclude him from carving out a niche role starting from the slot.                                                </div>

<br />
It'd be easy to brush off the McKinnon signing based on the mid-June timing, had he not fully taken over the backfield during KC's playoff run in 2021. In fact, from Week 18 through the first 3 rounds of the playoffs, McKinnon averaged 14.3 fantasy points (PPR) and over four receptions per game. When CEH returned from injury in the Divisonal Round, McKinnon doubled his touches (30 vs 15). <br />
<br />
With an established pass-catching background and obvious trust from the coaching staff to let him loose during the postseason, McKinnon should be considered with a late-round pick across all fantasy formats. <br />
<br />
As for Edwards-Helaire, it further creates doubt about his pass-catching role in the Chiefs offense.  His 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs in 2021. The mark was also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and McKinnon (1.15).                                                </div>

<br />
With arguably the worst yards per scrimmage play in the class, TDP initially looked like a carbon copy of the 49ers' third-round pick last season Trey Sermon. His profile as a gap scheme runner makes the pick questionable to a zone-heavy team.<br />
<br />
Davis-Price is also not elusive - 29th in broken tackle rate per Sports Info Solutions - so he will require wide-open lanes to be effective. He also struggles to create yards after contact. His 2.8 yards after contact per attempt ranks 28th in the class.<br />

But all of these concerns are being baked into his free ADP, which isn't capturing his initial burst and long speed - 77th percentile 40-yard dash and 73rd percentile 10-yard split time -  or the important metric regarding his Year 1 projection: Round 3 draft capital. And above all, the 49ers' offense breeds an efficient running game like no other.<br />
<br />
It's not hard to envision a scenario where the 49ers are forced to turn to their physical bruising rookie running back in the wake of a potential injury to an undersized Elijah Mitchell in 2022 or just use the two in tandem.<br />
<br />
San Fran's coaching staff liked the way Davis-Price bullied over defenders in the 4th quarters of games at the college level, so it's easy to picture him in a similar "finisher" role in the pros.                                                </div>

Jones averaged a 25% target share, 10.7 half-point fantasy points per game (27th) and 12.8 expected half-point fantasy points per game (18th) in the team's final five games including playoffs.<br />
He also led the team in total air yards (1,136).<br />
The former Raider is bound to be overlooked in fantasy despite a strong 2021 finish, so consider me a buyer in the very late rounds and in dynasty. Jones will be a starter on the outside and inherit the wide receiver role previously occupied by Laquon Treadwell.<br />
The former first-round pick finished the final six weeks of the fantasy season 10th in receiving yards with 381 - 64 per game.<br />
<br />
Jones, like Treadwell, also finished the last five weeks top-10 in PFF receiving grade versus man coverage - further bolstering Jones' case as a future playmaker on the boundary.                                                </div>

Tolbert also boasts a 19-year-old breakout age - his player profile stacks up with some top wideouts from his class.<br />
<br />
And although Tolbert doesn't possess elite speed - 57th percentile 40-yard dash time - he still understands how to get open deep. He's similar to Adam Thielen in that fashion.<br />
<br />
If Tolbert can beat out James Washington - on a one-year $1.2M contract -  in training camp, he could offer immediate value with Michael Gallup unlikely to be ready for Week 1 coming off a torn ACL. <br />
<br />
He's got big-play ability that should gel well with quarterback Dak Prescott.                                                </div>

And when he play indoors over that stretch, his points per game was just north of nine fantasy points per game.                                                </div>

Meanwhile, Marlon Mack signed a 1-year $2 million deal, and rookie Dameon Pierce was drafted in the fourth round.<br />
<br />
I envision Mack/Pierce duking out work on early downs, while Burkhead slides in as the primary pass-catching back after he ranked sixth in route participation over the last four weeks of the 2021 season. The receiving role is the one to target in this backfield for a team that projects to be playing from behind frequently.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Burkhead came over from the New England Patriots last year alongside general manager Nick Caserio, so there's a built-in connection from management to the field. It's no coincidence that Burkhead nearly doubled his career highs in rushing attempts, rushing yards, and games started in his first year with Houston in 2021.<br />
<br />
And over the past two seasons, Burkhead has flashed a high weekly fantasy ceiling. He's crested 22-plus weekly fantasy points thrice since 2020. Mack has totaled 21.5 fantasy points over that span.                                                </div>

After all, Wilson is a 27-year old wide receiver that has yet to total 1,000 total receiving yards since being drafted in 2018.<br />

Leaving a high-powered Dallas offense for a Miami offense led by an unproven quarterback makes it less likely Wilson delivers as many spike weeks as he did in 2021 - even as a more full-time player.                                                </div>

Pittsburgh never attempted more kicks than they did in 2021 versus recent years, so expecting Boswell to run back a K3 performance seems slightly far-fetched. His 89% conversion rate on 50-plus yard FGs is primed to regress. <br />
<br />
Although his routine 90%-plus FG hit rate does suggest he can be a low-end kicker or streamable piece if the Steelers offense plays conservatives with a rookie QB.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Gronk's departure from Tampa also impacts the Buccaneers tight end room massively because it thrusts Cameron Brate in the starting tight end role - the Harvard man is under contract till 2024. <br />
<br />
Although Brate was a non-factor in the games he filled in for Gronkowski last season. He averaged just three targets and 3.8 fantasy points per game. However, he was splitting snaps with O.J. Howard (signed with Buffalo this offseason), so there's reason to believe he will have a more fruitful role in 2022. Not to mention his competition for targets last season - Chris Godwin, Mike Evans, and Antonio Brown - will look much less menacing to open the year between mostly Evans and Russell Gage.<br />
<br />
He's easily worth drafting in Best Ball drafts while his price remains cheap, but don't go out over your skies to snag him in redraft formats. His sub-9% target rate per route run while Gronk was sidelined doesn't necessarily enthrall confidence that Brate is Brady's guy. You're hoping he emerges as a boom-or-bust TD scorer based on his 20 red-zone targets - tied for 2nd with several tight ends - from last season. It wouldn't be the first time Brate would be a fantasy TE1 having finished top-8 in 2016 and 2017.                                                </div>

He'll have to beat out first-round rookie Kenny Pickett, however. Trubisky's 2018 season with the Bears raised hopes; his 2019 and 2020 seasons dashed them. Running ability and an NFL-caliber arm raise hopes that Trubisky's fantasy value can be rehabilitated.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Michigan's Hassan Haskins was one of my favorite running back sleepers before the NFL Draft. I claimed I'd be in on him if he got Round 4 draft capital, and Haskins did exactly that being selected 131st overall.<br />
<br />
He broke out in a big way as "the guy" for the Wolverines in 2021, earning a 23 percent dominator rating, raising his career dominator rating to 20 percent.<br />
<br />
With an identical PFF rushing grade to Breece Hall (91.6) over the last three seasons, Haskins looked primed to exceed expectations in the NFL. He offers a lot of size at 6-foot-2 and 228 pounds, so he can handle a heavy workload. The Michigan product also led his entire class in rushing attempts inside the five-yard line (29), which gives him a real shot at carving out a goal-line role in the pros.<br />
<br />
Haskins will never see the field as long as Derrick Henry stays healthy. But there's zero doubt in my mind that he's the clear direct back-up for Henry, who showed us last season that he is mortal.                                                </div>

It's too early to write off Mayfield entirely, but at best he's a game manager with limited fantasy value.                                                </div>

<br />
But the dream of a full-time role for McKenzie will have to wait after the team signed former Jets slot wide receiver Jamison Crowder (WR - BUF) to a one-year $4M deal. He is making almost as much money in 2021 alone as McKenzie is over two years ($4.4M). <br />
<br />
Needless to say, Crowder will likely be the Day 1 starter in the slot and fantasy gamers will have to wait for another injury for McKenzie to see a fantasy-worthy role. Remember this coaching staff is the same unit that played 33-year-old Emmanuel Sanders (WR - BUF) over Gabriel Davis (WR - BUF) for 80% of the 2021 season.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt they will do the same with Crowder and McKenzie in 2022.                                                </div>

He's entering his age-25 season, so there's a flicker of hope left, but time is running out, and he has rookie Matt Corral breathing down his neck.                                                </div>

The former Michigan Wolverine finished as PFF's fifth-highest graded receiver and 10th-best pass-blocker at the running back position. <br />
His 2.11 yards per route run ranked 4th-best among all RBs, which suggests he has a legitimate shot to take over third-down duties in the Bengals backfield. <br />
But there's a case to be made that he would also thrive if an injury should occur to Mixon with an equally excellent rushing skill set. Evans' elusive rating ranked No. 1 and his yards after contact per attempt (4.05) ranked fourth. <br />
Fantasy gamers got a glimpse of Evans potential in a feature role in Week 18, when the Bengals rested their starters. Evans played 56% of the snaps in the regular season finale, compiling 13.9 fantasy points - seven carries for 35 yards and four catches for 24 yards on five targets.                                                </div>

<br />
His impressive season earned him a three-year deal worth $21 million with the New York Jets.<br />
<br />
But the Jets also signed ex-Bengals tight end C.J. Uzomah in free agency and drafted Ohio State tight end Jeremy Ruckert in the third round. The situation looks horrible for Conklin in a potential three-way tight end committee in a bad to below average offense.<br />
<br />
However, the situation alone has made Conklin virtually free across the board in early best ball drafts, and I think he's worth the late-round dart throw. The former Minnesota Viking should be the favorite to earn primary pass-catching duties.                                                </div>

The undersized explosive running back enjoyed a breakout season in his final season at Missouri stepping out of Larry Roundtree's shadow. His 916 yards after contact ranked fifth-best in the class.<br />
Quite the feat for a sub-200 pound running back. But what's more impressive is Badie's 124 catches during his four-year tenure in college - capped off by 52 receptions in 2021. That was the highest mark among all 2022 draft-eligible backs.<br />
There's no guarantee that either J.K. Dobbins or Gus Edwards will come out the gates hot coming off torn ACLs, so the 2021 sixth-rounder could see a larger role than many would expect from a Day 3 selection. At worst, he'd be my favorite to emerge as the No. 3 RB because I have zero faith in either Mike Davis/Justice Hill maintaining any consistent role on the Ravens offense.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">Justyn Ross looked the part of college football's next superstar after a breakout freshman season. At 18 years old, Ross led the Clemson Tigers in receiving yards despite playing alongside older teammates Tee Higgins, Amari Rodgers and Hunter Renfrow who were future pros. He was PFF's second-highest-graded WR in his first season (91.2).<br />
The 6-foot-4 and 205-pound wideout followed up with an impressive sophomore campaign, leading the team in receptions (66) as Trevor Lawrence's most heavily targeted receiver.<br />
Ross was well on his way to being a locked-and-loaded Round 1 selection for the 2021 NFL Draft, but a rare condition affecting his neck and spine forced him to miss the entire 2020 season.<br />
He came back in 2021 to show that he was fully healthy, but an anemic Clemson offense that ranked 87th in PFF's grading torpedoed his numbers. Only 64% of his targets were deemed catchable, which ranked in the 28th percentile.<br />
He's an underrated route runner at his size, but not a contested-catch fiend. Reminds me a lot of Corey Davis because Ross is not particularly explosive.<br />
The injury concerns made Ross go undrafted, but he landed in the best situation with Kansas City.<br />
The floor is rock bottom, but Ross' experience playing special teams does give me some hope that he can stick to the bottom of the depth chart in KC. The talent is so apparent that I wouldn't be totally shocked if he makes some noise - health withstanding.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">The most appealing part about the KC backfield is identifying the potential goal-line back. And there's a scenario where that guy is Derrick Gore.<br />
<br />
New Cardinals RB Darrel Williams played that role last season, and Gore flashed red-zone usage last season in Week 8 with six red-zone touches. Many will point to Gore's undrafted status as a reason to believe he won't be a factor in 2022. But the team's belief in fellow UDFA Williams suggests that the team won't shy away from Gore if he is indeed the best option for the job.<br />
<br />
He was superior to both Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Ronald Jones last season in PFF rushing grade and yards after contact per attempt. Gore was also uber-efficient in the passing game, finishing fourth in the NFL in yards per route run. It's a small sample size with just nine targets, but it's encouraging that he shows proficiency in the receiving game.                                                </div>

First, he was taken one spot before me by FantasyPros' own Pat Fitzmaurice after I waxed poetic about him on Pat's Fitz on Fantasy podcast. Then he got swept up right before my pick in another dynasty rookie draft.<br />
<br />
I believe he has some sneaky Hunter Renfrow-like slot skill that most will overlook, but NFL teams like the Titans will love.<br />
<br />
Philips commanded a 30 percent target share in 2021 at UCLA and could potentially become a top underneath option for Ryan Tannehill in Tennessee.                                                </div>

He landed with the Titans, who don't seem to be in any hurry to replace starter Ryan Tannehill. Willis has a big arm and is a potential difference-maker as a runner, but he needs a lot of refinement. Whenever Willis gets his first NFL playing time, the results are more likely to be reminiscent of late-career Cam Newton than current Josh Allen.                                                </div>

                                                <div class="player-note">After going undrafted, rookie Abram Smith signed with the New Orleans Saints as a UDFA with a $222,000 guaranteed contract - one of the biggest guarantees for any rookie free agent around the league in recent years.<br />
<br />
It's a strong indicator that Smith will likely crack the final 53-man roster, and his special-teams ability will be his pathway to being active on game day.<br />
<br />
Just dressing for games is half the battle for many rookies, so for Smith to have a realistic path as a UDFA should not be ignored. And neither should the general ambiguity surrounding Alvin Kamara's legal matters after he was arrested in Las Vegas during the Pro Bowl.<br />
<br />
If Kamara is suspended for any allotment of time, Smith is looking at a depth chart composed of Mark Ingram, Tony Jones Jr., Dwayne Washington, and Devine Ozigbo.<br />
<br />
Ingram just turned 32. Jones was a UDFA in 2020 and bombed in his lone start in 2021. Washington has been on the roster for four seasons and has totaled 47 carries.<br />
<br />
It's not far-fetched to think that Smith is going to have a role on an ascending Saints offense sooner rather than later. He would hardly be the first UDFA success story to come out of New Orleans ie. Khiry Robinson, Chris Ivory, and Pierre Thomas.                                                </div>

<br />
It's important to denote that his deep-threat profile -- fourth in aDOT (16.7) in 2021 - suggests he will be the team's field stretcher on an offense filled to the brim with elite underneath options between Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow, and Darren Waller.<br />
<br />
The subsequent trade of Bryan Edwards further bolsters my take on Hollins carving out that No. 3 receiver role on a high-powered pass-heavy offense.<br />
<br />
He will never get doubled with all the other weapons on the Vegas offense, making him an extremely appetizing final-round best-ball option, especially in Raiders stacks.                                                </div>

Harty saw an extremely high target rate per route run in 2021 (27%) and finished sixth in both PFF receiving grade (86.8) and yards per route run (2.69).<br />
He had over 52 receiving yards in three of Jameis Winston's starts last season, which indicates to me he has some built-in rapport with the quarterback. If a starting opportunity opens in the Saints offense, I'm confident Harty would deliver fantasy goodness.                                                </div>
