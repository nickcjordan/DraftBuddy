And that greatly benefits the team's lead ball-carrier Josh Jacobs. A more efficient offense lends itself to more scoring opportunities, and Jacobs will reap the most rewards as the team's primary red-zone back.\n\nLast year's RB13 smashed career highs in all receiving categories in 2021 despite playing alongside Kenyan Drake and Jalen Richard. Injuries to the back-ups boosted Jacobs' role as a receiver slightly, but it was not the only cause.\n\nThere was a deliberate effort to feature Jacobs more as a receiver with him catching at least two passes in 12 of his 15 games played. And more importantly, the receiving capability that Jacobs displayed puts to rest the narrative that he is \"game-script\" dependent. Whether the Raiders are winning or losing in a loaded 2022 AFC West, JJ has proven he can be used in all facets.\n\nNow the Raiders did elect to sign both Brandon Bolden and Ameer Abdullah this offseason to bolster their running back stable behind Jacobs. Bolden has been a special teams guy nearly his entire career, so I doubt he carves out any legitimate role on offense. \n\nAbdullah has been used as a third-down back on the several teams he has been on at the NFL level, but I am not ready to declare him as a huge threat to Jacobs' workload. Sure he might work in some, but not enough to hurt Jacobs' bottom-line value. The team also drafted Zamir White in the fourth round, but I would not expect much from White in year one based on Josh McDaniels' track record from New England of not featuring Day 3 rookie RBs. \n\nThe new head coach is more likely to run Jacobs into the ground on an expiring contract as he did with Dion Lewis, LeGarrette Blount and Shane Vereen during his Patriots tenure.\n\nAnd besides, the red-zone role is the most significant for fantasy points, and that looks to be clearly in Jacobs' grasp.\n\nTwo-down back Damien Harris was in the red-zone role for the Patriots last season and flourished because of it. He ranked fourth in carries (46) and third in rushing TDs (13) from inside the 20-yard line.

After the new coaching regime and management did not exercise his 5th-year option, Jacobs could be in his last year in the silver and black. Over the last three years, only Dalvin Cook has more red-zone rushing attempts than Jacobs so you're banking on 8+ rushing TDs on the ground.

The poor rushing efficiency is bearable, but the poor receiving usage is hard to ignore. Especially considering his calling card out of LSU was catching balls out of the backfield.\n\nHis 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs - also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and Jerick McKinnon (1.15). \n\nSome may also feel that the Ronald Jones addition is the final nail in the coffin for CEH, but it's not that black and white. Don't get me wrong though - Jones is a significant threat to earn more carries than Edwards-Helaire after the former first-rounder posted worse rushing efficiency numbers than his rookie season. But full transparency - Jones was not much better ranking 51st in the same category (2.5). \n\nIt's actually a positive sign for Edwards-Helaire that the team brought in Jones instead of re-signing McKinnon or Williams. Those ex-Chiefs backs were proven pass-catchers and limited CEH's role as a receiver.\n\nI'd presume that Edwards-Helaire will fully take over the primary pass-catching role - which was the reason why the Chiefs drafted him in the 1st round in any way - while also working in tandem with Jones as a rusher on early downs. \n\nJones splitting work might also help keep CEH healthy after his 10 missed games the past two seasons. \n\nThe other RBs on the Chiefs current roster include Derrick Gore (4th-year UDFA), Isiah Pacheco (2022 7th-rounder), Jerrion Ealy (2022 UDFA) and Tayon Fleet-Davis (2022 UDFA).

That will make his 2021 production difficult to replicate.\n\nThe tight end/slot receiver hybrid finished sixth in receptions, ninth in receiving yards, fourth in route participation (78%), and fifth in target share (17%) through 18 weeks of action of the 2021 season. This receiving and route volume led to only moderate success in fantasy football, as Mike Gesicki finished as TE9.\n\nHis efficiency metrics left something to be desired, though - he was 13th in fantasy points per game (9.9) and 15th in yards per route run. Part of that does fall on the up-and-down quarterback play, but it just further cements Gesicki as a good, not great tight end in fantasy football. \n\nMy biggest concern is that Gesicki has almost always underwhelmed after the catch - which will likely be a large part of the Dolphins new-look offense.

Often viewed as a safe fantasy WR2 during his time in L.A. - he was WR17 before his injury in 2021 - Woods might be subject to some poor game conditions in the Titans' run-heavy approach that could nuke his weekly fantasy appeal.\n\nHe's got a chance to be the No. 1 receiver if rookie Treylon Burks fails to hit the ground running, but anything less will not be fruitful for the seasoned veteran. \n\n\nOver the past two seasons, production has not been kind to WRs over 30 years old. Only three receivers over 30 - Cole Beasley, Adam Thielen, and Marvin Jones Jr. - finished as top-40 fantasy options. If he stays healthy, Woods could easily beat his ADP. \n\nBut I'm just not sure how high his fantasy ceiling is based on the situation.

Considering Gaskins' fantasy spike weeks in 2021 all came from his receiving usage, Edmonds should find similar success in that role with Miami.\n\nThe late signing of running back Mostert and Michel might have some fantasy gamers soured on Edmonds. However, Edmonds was never going to see a full bell-cow workload. Losing out on some early-down carries to Mostert or Michel was to be expected. I'd still prefer Edmonds in fantasy due to the pass-catching and hope the other signings keeps his ADP at a value.

Despite all his shortcomings as a passer, Jackson still finished the season second in expected fantasy points per game (23.8) and seventh in fantasy points per game (21.3).\n\nHis expected fantasy point per game output marked the highest of his career thanks to the Ravens' willingness to throw more in 2021.

He did so five times in 2021, with Baltimore throwing at a 60% clip. \n\nHowever, I would not anticipate the pass-heavy approach to continue into 2022. Their philosophical change on offense was forced out of necessity based on the injuries. But a lack of passing doesn't impact Jackson they way it does most other QBs with his greatest fantasy asset being his legs.  \n\nJackson may never recapture his 2019 rare MVP form when he averaged north of 28 fantasy points per game, but a 22-point per game average seems like his norm based on his last two years of fantasy production.

This could easily be the case again in 2022, but there are some reasons for optimism here. Winston will be entering his third season of this offensive scheme, so he should know it inside and out by now. Hopefully, the Saints get Michael Thomas back healthy to pair with newly drafted Chris Olave. This moves Marquez Callaway into a more reasonable WR3 role. This cast of weapons with Alvin Kamara also on board could lead to more passing attempts that we didn't see in 2021.

Mike Gesicki, Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill are all being pushed up the rankings/draft boards with hopes that Tua Tagovailoa takes a massive step forward in Year 3 under first-year head coach Mike McDaniel.\n\nI am not as optimistic that Tagovailoa can be the vehicle to deliver fantasy goodness to all these pieces in South Beach because this offense is going to be run-heavy. McDaniel made his way up the coaching ranks under Kyle Shanahan as a standout run-game coordinator. And should he follow in the footsteps of Shanahan as the offensive mastermind in Miami, fantasy managers should expect a lot of rushing and YAC schemes.\n\n49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo ranked 29th in aDOT in 2021 (7.6) after ranking 39th and 35th in the category the two years prior.  Tagovailoa's aDOT was 34th in the league (7.6) in 2021. \n\nJimmy G's most productive seasons have seen him average just north of 16 fantasy points per game - good for QB17 in 2021. Tagovailoa has yet to eclipse 14 fantasy points per game two years into his career. He also ranked 31st in throwing at the intermediate level (62.5 PFF grade) among 37 qualifying passers last season.\n\nSo although Tua is viewed as a popular late-round quarterback among fantasy circles, I have to admit I won't be pulling the trigger on him in 1QB redraft formats. Especially with his brutal early schedule. New England, Baltimore and Buffalo are hardly the stream-worthy spots you will be confident in starting the southpaw QB. In the Dolphins quarterback's four combined starts versus those teams in 2021, his fantasy finishes were QB23, QB24, QB18 and QB16.

The LSU product also rushed for just 118 yards and two TDs. He rushed for fewer yards than Mac Jones, who is notorious for being ranked low across consensus due to his lack of upside as a rusher.\n\nHowever, there is a legitimate path for Burrow's upside to be further unlocked if the Bengals increase their pass rate as they did during his rookie season and down the playoff stretch. Burrow led the NFL in passing attempts per game (40.4) during his rookie season and averaged 38 passing attempts/23.0 fantasy points per game in his final six weeks \n\nAn uptick in passing volume won't help Burrow's efficiency per se, but his fantasy numbers will be much more stable from week to week.\n\nAlso can't forget to mention the Bengals revamped their offensive line as they look to not let their franchise quarterback get sacked 70 times - 22 more than the next closest quarterback.

Hill's aDOT also dipped dramatically to 10.6, which was the lowest it's been since his rookie season.\n\nAnd It's undeniable that going from Patrick Mahomes to Tua Tagovailoa is a massive downgrade for Hill.

Especially with Tagovailoa's lack of a confident deep ball, a prominent running game, and Jaylen Waddle also heavily involved in the offensive game plan. Sure, Hill will have his weeks when he is peppered with low-value targets in PPR formats, but the massive downfield touchdowns will happen much less frequently.

From date of surgery to Week 1, Wilson will have just under 4 weeks to be ready for Week 1, making it likely the Jets start Joe Flacco against the Ravens.

That said, it's still likely that Hamler will require time to ramp up his involvement in practice, making it unlikely he's a consistent contributor for the Broncos early in the season. Based on how severe his injuries were, Hamler will be an outlier if he's able to produce in a meaningful way, especially considering he's likely behind Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton for targets. It's possible he provides a more meaningful role for the Broncos as a field stretcher than as a consistent fantasy option.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"21759","position":"WIDERECEIVER","overallPoints":145,"avgPoints":8.5,"positionRank":68,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":0,"rushingTouchdowns":0,"receptions":47,"receivingYards":684,"receivingTouchdowns":5,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":0,"risk":6,"name":"KJ Hamler","blurb":"It's hard to remember after tearing his ACL a year ago and having hip issues but the Broncos took Hamler in the 2nd Round of the 2020 NFL Draft, the same draft they selected Jerry Jeudy.

For as well as J.K. Dobbins performed in fantasy football from Weeks 11-17 in full PPR (RB11) during the 2020 season, guess who outscored him... J.D. McKissic. That's because McKissic caught 37 passes versus Dobbins' three.\n\nGuys like Derrick Henry can overcome the lack of receiving work because they are entrenched bell cows, but that's not the case with Dobbins in Baltimore with Gus Edwards also in the mix. Dobbins only slightly out-touched Edwards 86-74 down the stretch in 2020.\n\nIt would be pure ignorance to assume that Dobbins will take over the backfield considering Edwards has been excellent with every opportunity he has received.\n\nDobbins also ran extremely hot when it came to scoring touchdowns, scoring at least one TD in every game from Week 11 on. His nine total rushing TDs ranked 12th in the league and nearly doubled his expected output (5.5, 30th) - the sixth-highest difference at the position.\n\nDrafters have to understand that to invest in Dobbins as a late third-rounder or fourth-rounder (RB20, 50th overall ADP) he needs to run hot in the TD category coming off the season-ending ACL injury. They also should expect zero-to-little pass-game work with Jackson's tendency to not check down along with the additions of receiving backs, veteran Mike Davis and rookie Tyler Badie.

He tore the ACL in his left knee late in the preseason and underwent ACL reconstruction surgery on September 7. Initially, the details surrounding Dobbins' injury weren't explicitly clear, but we now have confirmation that in addition to injuring his ACL, Dobbins also injured his meniscus and his LCL, the ligament that runs on the outside of the knee. This multi-ligament reconstruction makes the rehab process more complicated and slower than an isolated ACL injury. The good news is that he’ll have approximately one year from the date of his surgery to the start of the regular season. The bad news is that data across the board shows athletes tend to perform better in their second season after the surgery compared to their first, and when you add in additional tissue damage, the outcomes are even worse. In addition, a 2022 study found that running backs and linebackers in particular are affected more than other positions in terms of returning to pre-injury performance following ACL surgery. Dobbins opened Ravens camp on the PUP list but was activated on August 8, giving him roughly one month of practice time ahead of Week 1. While this is encouraging for his overall recovery, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be 100% to open the year. He's more likely to be effective in the 2nd half of the season compared to the first.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"21674","position":"RUNNINGBACK","overallPoints":178,"avgPoints":10.5,"positionRank":29,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":814,"rushingTouchdowns":8,"receptions":26,"receivingYards":190,"receivingTouchdowns":1,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":1,"risk":7,"name":"J.K.

This offense should revert to being top-5 in rush rate in 2022 making Dobbins's current 5th round ADP a possible value IF he can return to form. There's a chance Dobbins won't be ready for Week 1, but given that Gus Edwards if further behind Dobbins in his ACL recovery and the team only brought in declining or middling talent (shout out to Mike Davis), this should be Dobbins' job once healthy.

Before the finger derailed his season, Russ led the NFL in yards per attempt (10.4), passer rating (133.6) and passer rating from a clean pocket (130.9) before Week 5. Wilson also finished the season on a high note, averaging over 24 fantasy points per game in his last three contests.\n\nAll in all, 2021 was a typical season for Wilson: peaks and valleys. He averaged 23 fantasy points per game from Weeks 1-4 and Weeks 16-18. In his six games post-injury, Wilson averaged an abysmal 13 fantasy points per game. Buy the inevitable 2022 dip on the future Hall of Fame quarterback in a new situation.\n\nThat combined with a plethora of weapons in Denver, makes it very plausible he sees similar immediate success that other quarterbacks like Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford have had since changing teams late into their careers.\n\nHowever a QB10 ADP might be too rich, as I think he belongs in the same tier as Kirk Cousins, Derek Carr, and Matthew Stafford. \n\nCurrently, he's the only QB drafted inside the top-12 that failed to hit the fantasy QB1 mark at least 50% of the time in 2021.\n\nHe also has the lowest top-6 hit rate (15%), lowest top-12 rate (46%), and second-highest bust rate among the top-12 ADP.\n\nConsidering the only \"upgrade\" Wilson has moved from Denver to Seattle is more favorable coaching (not necessarily receiver personnel, especially with the underrated loss of Tim Patrick), he's likely going to be inconsistent and overvalued due to a lack of rushing juice.

He ranked 27th in yards after contact per attempt, immediately ahead of James Conner and Alvin Kamara (minimum 100 rushing attempts, per PFF). After his return to New Orleans, he posted 1.31 yards per route run which would have ranked 25th last year among all running backs with 20 or more targets (per PFF).

After failing to eclipse 1.05 yards per route run in his first three years at San Diego State, Bellinger posted 1.66 yards per route run (33rd, minimum 20 targets per PFF) in his final season. Where Bellinger really shined was after the catch, where he was seventh in YAC per reception (per PFF). He can further explore this part of his game at the NFL after testing extremely well at the combine. He finished with a 75th percentile or better speed score, burst score, and catch radius (per Playerprofiler.com). While rookie tight ends aren't usually players we look to in redraft, Bellinger could make some noise in his first season. From camp reports, he's already running with the first team and could walk into Week 1 as the team's unquestioned starter. We saw Brian Daboll heavily utilize a similarly athletic tight end in Dawson Knox last year in Buffalo. Knox finished as the TE9 in fantasy points per game on the strength of 19 red zone targets (fourth-most) and nine total touchdowns (second-most). The Giants' offense likely won't give Bellinger that many scoring opportunities, but the upside is there to carve out a weekly red zone role and surprise in fantasy football.

The exact diagnosis here is not known. However, Sean McVay described the injury as 'a little bit abnormal for a quarterback” and 'more of a baseball injury.' The two most common elbow injuries in MLB pitchers are flexor tendinitis and UCL (Tommy John ligament) injuries. Given that Stafford confirmed he received a PRP injection in his right elbow after the Super Bowl for an issue that he played through last season, this is likely tendinitis, which leads to pain at the inside of the elbow during gripping and throwing. It is essentially an overuse injury, so by limiting his reps right now, the team is hopeful they can manage the issue throughout the season. This is unlikely to heal completely until after the season, so expect LA to manage Stafford's reps weekly in-season. That said, he does not appear to be in any danger of missing time.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"9038","position":"QUARTERBACK","overallPoints":346,"avgPoints":20.4,"positionRank":11,"passingTouchdowns":36,"passingYards":4720,"rushingYards":46,"rushingTouchdowns":0,"receptions":0,"receivingYards":0,"receivingTouchdowns":0,"interceptionsThrown":15,"fumblesLost":4,"risk":4,"name":"Matthew Stafford","blurb":"Stafford’s top-5 finish feels a bit flawed when you consider some of the major flops (MIN & BAL) he had towards the end of the year for fantasy managers.

Edwards’ injury occurred on September 9, so relative to Dobbins, Edwards will be slightly behind in terms of his recovery timeline. Speaking in late March, head coach John Harbaugh spoke about both backs stating, “There’s a chance both guys will start camp on PUP. We’ll play it safe with those guys and take our time.” Edwards did indeed land on the PUP list to open camp, and a recent report from ESPN confirmed that Edwards is actually behind Dobbins in terms of his recovery timeline and 'could miss a chunk of the season.' At this point, it appears likely Edwards won't be playing in Week 1, and he's a potential PUP candidate to open the season. If that's the case, he would miss the first four weeks of the regular season at a minimum. When he eventually does get cleared, expect Edwards to see a reduced workload as he comes back from his injury.

McKissic, who was concussed in Week 12 and did not return for the rest of the season. From that point on, Gibson saw five targets per game. Overall, he still tied with Joe Mixon for 2nd most 1st downs among all RBs. But the TDs were the major story. In 2020, he had a TD every 15 carries; in 2021, that regressed to every 37 carries. Gibson's preseason and training camp thus far has left his fantasy value hanging in the balance. Brian Robinson looks like he's a legitimate threat for early down and goal line work while J.D.

It's possible that 2022 presents a similar issue with Robinson as Etienne makes his professional debut. \n\nBut JRob does deserve credit for maintaining efficient play whenever he got opportunities last season, finishing 11th in yards after contact per attempt (3.3) and 8th in red-zone touchdowns (8). \n\nHis real hurdle for fantasy relevance besides fending off a 2022 first-round running back is attempting a speedy recovery from a torn Achilles suffered in late December. He was unable to participate in OTAs, while his backfield counterpart is full-go as the team installs the new-look Doug Pederson offense. The former undrafted free agent is not guaranteed to be ready for Week 1. Although he did avoid being placed on the PUP list, which is encouraging for his short-term availability. \n\nIt's hard to envision Robinson being anything more than a speculative zero-RB target, with hopes that he can recapture 2020 form if given the volume.

Despite the incredible recovery from Akers a year ago, fantasy managers expecting this to be the norm after Achilles surgery are likely to be disappointed. The majority of research is conclusive that this is a 9+ month recovery process that can take up to a year. Realistically, Robinson is unlikely to be 100% at the start of the season, but it is notable that he was able to avoid the PUP list to open training camp. As of early August, it remains to be seen what sort of workload Robinson will get early in camp, and his progress throughout August will be important to monitor.

The spliced-up workload and his declining effectiveness could result from the injury or his advancing age and the toll that the NFL has taken on him. Elliott has amassed 1,938 touches (22 per game) over his six-year career, never handling less than 268 touches in any season. Elliott should be viewed as an RB2 in many formats that could slowly dissolve into a high-end RB3 if Tony Pollard gets more run in 2022.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Elliott started the season on a high note banking weekly fantasy finishes of RB8 or better in four of his first five games. However, from Week 6 on, it was a different story for Elliott, who was playing with a partially torn PCL in his knee starting in Week 5 when he first popped up on the Cowboys’ injury report. In season, this injury can lead to pain, stiffness, and mild swelling making it difficult to be effective in the short term. However, research shows that so long as this ligament injury is not a complete tear, professional athletes can perform at pre-injury levels with rehab. Keenan Allen is another NFL player who has a history of a partially torn PCL.

He still was solid and in a season with lots of injuries at the RB position, he felt more like a low-end RB1 than someone who finished at RB6.

While he might not have top 3-5 upside anymore if Dillon remains involved, Jones could still be a low-end RB1 or high-end RB2.

The Packers have the 5th most vacated targets in the NFL and our research shows often the RB position is the one that benefits the most when there is turnover.

lack of opportunities, either. He finished top-15 in route participation (68%) and had almost zero competition for targets with injuries to Kenny Golladay, Kadarius Toney and Sterling Shepard.\nAlas, Engram failed to command any worthwhile target share with his abysmal 14% target rate per route run. So consider me slightly hesitant to buy into Engram breaking out in 2022 because his new head coach has a history of featuring tight ends. Sure, it works in Engram's favor, but last I checked Dan Arnold is still on the team. And Doug Pederson has also been known to heavily feature two tight ends in his offense, which doesn't always translate to fantasy success.

Jacksonville TEs saw 19 percent of the team's targets and for a five-week stretch in the middle of the season before getting injured, Dan Arnold saw 7.4 targets a game.

He was competing for targets with senior Chris Olave and sophomore standout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who led the nation in PFF receiving grade (91.7). \n\nGoing beyond the box score reveals that Wilson is a versatile route runner who can align anywhere on the field and still win.\n\nHe was selected by the New York Jets 10th overall and joins a somewhat crowded WR room. And nobody can be sure Zach Wilson can support one or multiple fantasy assets. There are definitely question marks.\n\nHowever, Wilson is worth betting on because he's shown the ability at Ohio State to command targets and produce in an offense littered with other elite talents. Doesn't hurt his chance that he was deemed open on 84% of his targets last season.

He was a top-10 running back in PPR averaging 17 fantasy points per game averaging just south of 15 touches per game.\n\nHunt's true upside will always be capped in a backfield as the Robin to Chubb's Batman. But should an injury occur to Chubb or another star running back, Hunt would easily flirt with league-winning upside if he is awarded the requisite volume to do so.\n\nHis 6th-ranked yards after contact per attempt (3.54), 6th-ranked yards per route run (1.81) and 26% target rate suggest he's not slowing down entering age 27-season. All he needs his a change of scenery to recapture his rookie year accolades when he lead the NFL in rushing yards.
