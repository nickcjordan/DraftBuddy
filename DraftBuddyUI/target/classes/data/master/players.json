And more importantly, the receiving capability that Jacobs displayed puts to rest the narrative that he is \"game-script\" dependent. Whether the Raiders are winning or losing in a loaded 2022 AFC West, JJ has proven he can be used in all facets.\n\nNow the Raiders did elect to sign both Brandon Bolden and Ameer Abdullah this offseason to bolster their running back stable behind Jacobs. Bolden has been a special teams guy nearly his entire career, so I doubt he carves out any legitimate role on offense. \n\nAbdullah has been used as a third-down back on the several teams he has been on at the NFL level, but I am not ready to declare him as a huge threat to Jacobs' workload. Sure he might work in some, but not enough to hurt Jacobs' bottom-line value. The team also drafted Zamir White in the fourth round, but I would not expect much from White in year one based on Josh McDaniels' track record from New England of not featuring Day 3 rookie RBs. \n\nThe new head coach is more likely to run Jacobs into the ground on an expiring contract as he did with Dion Lewis, LeGarrette Blount and Shane Vereen during his Patriots tenure.\n\nAnd besides, the red-zone role is the most significant for fantasy points, and that looks to be clearly in Jacobs' grasp.\n\nTwo-down back Damien Harris was in the red-zone role for the Patriots last season and flourished because of it. He ranked fourth in carries (46) and third in rushing TDs (13) from inside the 20-yard line.

The poor rushing efficiency is bearable, but the poor receiving usage is hard to ignore. Especially considering his calling card out of LSU was catching balls out of the backfield.\n\nHis 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs - also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and Jerick McKinnon (1.15). \n\nSome may also feel that the Ronald Jones addition is the final nail in the coffin for CEH, but it's not that black and white.

Those ex-Chiefs backs were proven pass-catchers and limited CEH's role as a receiver.\n\nI'd presume that Edwards-Helaire will fully take over the primary pass-catching role - which was the reason why the Chiefs drafted him in the 1st round in any way - while also working in tandem with Jones as a rusher on early downs. \n\nJones splitting work might also help keep CEH healthy after his 10 missed games the past two seasons. \n\nThe other RBs on the Chiefs current roster include Derrick Gore (4th-year UDFA), Isiah Pacheco (2022 7th-rounder), Jerrion Ealy (2022 UDFA) and Tayon Fleet-Davis (2022 UDFA).

days ago","text":"Nobody saw the Cordarelle Patterson ninth-year breakout coming. Unless, of course, you foresaw ex-Chicago Bears passing game coordinator Dave Ragone coming in as the Atlanta Falcons' new offensive coordinator just to install Patterson in a hybrid RB/WR role.\n\nFrom Weeks 1-14, fantasy football's RB7 - 15.8 fantasy points per game - was a revelation and a player who changed the tide of leagues as a waiver-wire acquisition.\n\nPatterson's only issue is that he stumbled across the fantasy football finish line, failing to eclipse more than nine fantasy points or 30 rushing yards in his last four games. The team also used him more in a committee alongside Mike Davis.\n\nNonetheless, the more bizarre part is that Patterson took a backseat in the receiving game despite his wide receiver background, totaling just seven targets in his final four games after averaging nearly five targets per game. Patterson's 25% target rate per route ranked No. 1 among all running backs.\n\nStill, even with the poor end to the season, Patterson's best case in free agency was always returning to the Falcons. He is such a specialized talent who needs to be used in a particular manner, which was executed to near perfection under Arthur Smith's tutelage.\n\nWith an overall lack of general playmakers after losing Calvin Ridley and Russell Gage, C-Patt should see a competent role in the Falcons offense. Whether it be as a receiver or rusher (or both), he's a solid bet to lead the backfield with lackluster RB talent on the team vying for touches and targets. \n\nWith Patterson's range of outcomes so wide for fantasy football, he should remain a draft target if his ADP stays in the later rounds. His RB30 ADP on early best-ball is a solid value.\n\nBut I'd be hard-pressed to admit that the Marcus Mariota signing is not ideal for Patterson's fantasy value. Rushing quarterbacks tend to check the ball down less frequently making it less likely Patterson sees less of a consistent target share.\n\nIn Mariota's last stint with the Titans, RBs totaled 4.6 targets per game (17.7% target share). Last year that number was at 8.2 targets per game (26.7% target share).

However, he ran out of gas in the final month (RB56, 31, 37, 70) which raises some questions heading into 2022. He scored more points as a receiver than as a rusher making him an odd RB to project moving forward.

It's a reminder to always sell high on Day 3 running backs that flash as rookies; they can be easily replaced and likely won't \"survive\" draft after draft without investment from their team.\n\nCarter's looking anywhere between five-to-eight touches per game with Hall entrenched as the bellcow, making the former UNC back near obsolete as anything other than a backup with some upside. \n\nFrom Weeks 7-9 with Tevin Coleman sidelined, Carter averaged 19 touches per game and a 66% snap share. He also finished 10th in yards after contact per attempt (3.4) and third in PFF's elusive rating.\n\nCarter's receiving ability also fueled four top-17 weekly finishes in 2021, three of which were inside the top-13 in games that featured quarterback checkdown king Mike White under center.

Nevertheless, Sutton finished the season as the fantasy WR46. \n\nHowever, even in the anemic offense, Sutton still finished seventh in air yards (1,756), cemented in between Tyler Lockett and D.K. Metcalf, in 2021.\n\nSutton has a real chance to recapture his elite form another year removed from his ACL injury. It also helps substantially that he has received an ultra upgrade at the quarterback position with Denver's trade for Russell Wilson. \n\nWilson has always been an elite downfield passer - he had the sixth-highest passer rating on throws of 20-plus air yards last season - which plays heavily into Sutton's strengths as a vertical threat.

The 49ers also surprisingly selected RB Tyrion Davis-Price in the 3rd round to add to any already nauseous backfield rotation.

Two key metrics at PFF that are important to analyze for QBs are performance in a clean pocket and throwing at the intermediate level.\n\nJackson ranked 28th in passer rating from a clean pocket (90.4) and 22nd in PFF passing grade at the intermediate level (70.0). Despite all his shortcomings as a passer, Jackson still finished the season second in expected fantasy points per game (23.8) and seventh in fantasy points per game (21.3).\n\nHis expected fantasy point per game output marked the highest of his career thanks to the Ravens' willingness to throw more in 2021. From 2019-2020, Jackson had 37 or more passing attempts in a game only four times. He did so five times in 2021, with Baltimore throwing at a 60% clip. \n\nHowever, I would not anticipate the pass-heavy approach to continue into 2022. Their philosophical change on offense was forced out of necessity based on the injuries. But a lack of passing doesn't impact Jackson they way it does most other QBs with his greatest fantasy asset being his legs.  \n\nJackson may never recapture his 2019 rare MVP form when he averaged north of 28 fantasy points per game, but a 22-point per game average seems like his norm based on his last two years of fantasy production. In 2020, he led all QBs in fantasy points per dropback. That cements him as a clear-cut top-5 fantasy QB.

News flash, people - Mack signed a one-year, $two-million deal with Houston, and it's less than the team is paying Rex Burkhead..1 million of Burkhead's $2.35 million contract is fully guaranteed.\n\nWe could easily see Mack released as much as we could see Pierce become the team's starting running back.\n\nAlthough my one reservation with Pierce is that traditionally New England has been very stingy about featuring rookie running backs historically - especially ones drafted late. During Nick Caserio's tenure with the Patriots, Stevan Ridley's 87 carries were the most for any non-first-round rookie running back.\n\nIt was until Caserio left New England for Houston, that Rhamondre Stevenson broke that mark with 133 carries in 2021.\n\nNot to mention, there's clearly an affinity with veteran running backs that Texans can't seem to quit. They force-fed David Johnson and Mark Ingram II among other veterans last season, despite having some younger players they could give reps to.\n\nCaserio's post-draft press conference cited Pierce as someone that needs to earn a role and be a factor on special teams. So pump the brakes on Pierce RB1 szn ever so slightly.\n\nThe fact Pierce never fully took over Florida's backfield does raise red flags. His 12% career dominator rating is eerily similar to Trey Sermon (12%) from last season, and Sermon struggled to separate himself from the pack in his rookie campaign. \n\nEven during his breakout senior season, the 5-foot-10 and 218-pound running back earned just a 22% dominator rating while sharing the backfield alongside fellow draft-eligible running back Malik Davis.\n\nHowever, I am willing to offer some benefit of the doubt after Pierce never topped 106 carries in college.\n\nThere may have been some underlying issue with former Gators head coach Dan Mullen that prevented Pierce from seeing a more featured role. Case in point: Pierce only had two games with double-digit carries in 2021, both of which came after Mullen was fired toward the end of the season. \n\nPierce's lackluster dominator rating doesn't capture his coach's potential ineptitude. The fact Pierce competed with NFL talent like Jordan Scarlett and La'Mical Perine very early in his college career paints a better picture of how his impact will be felt in years to come. But from the get-go, I doubt we see Pierce be a major fantasy factor to start the 2022 season.

Mike Gesicki, Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill are all being pushed up the rankings/draft boards with hopes that Tua Tagovailoa takes a massive step forward in Year 3 under first-year head coach Mike McDaniel.\n\nI am not as optimistic that Tagovailoa can be the vehicle to deliver fantasy goodness to all these pieces in South Beach because this offense is going to be run-heavy. McDaniel made his way up the coaching ranks under Kyle Shanahan as a standout run-game coordinator. And should he follow in the footsteps of Shanahan as the offensive mastermind in Miami, fantasy managers should expect a lot of rushing and YAC schemes.\n\n49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo ranked 29th in aDOT in 2021 (7.6) after ranking 39th and 35th in the category the two years prior.  Tagovailoa's aDOT was 34th in the league (7.6) in 2021. \n\nJimmy G's most productive seasons have seen him average just north of 16 fantasy points per game - good for QB17 in 2021. Tagovailoa has yet to eclipse 14 fantasy points per game two years into his career. He also ranked 31st in throwing at the intermediate level (62.5 PFF grade) among 37 qualifying passers last season.\n\nSo although Tua is viewed as a popular late-round quarterback among fantasy circles, I have to admit I won't be pulling the trigger on him in 1QB redraft formats. Especially with his brutal early schedule. New England, Baltimore and Buffalo are hardly the stream-worthy spots you will be confident in starting the southpaw QB. In the Dolphins quarterback's four combined starts versus those teams in 2021, his fantasy finishes were QB23, QB24, QB18 and QB16.

But his inefficient production is partially related to the juggernaut of run defenses he faced down the stretch - San Francisco 49ers (twice) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers - when in fact no Rams RB ran efficiently. 95% of his rushing yards in 2021 came after contact - the highest mark in the NFL.\n\nDid I also mention he was never even supposed to come back at ALL last season due his Achilles injury? If Travis Etienne came back from his injury and failed to perform, would that be held against his draft stock? \n\nThere's simply too much emphasis placed on Akers' production when touch volume is the key driver to fantasy success at running back. In the Rams' divisional playoff win versus the Buccaneers, Akers played 81% of the Los Angeles offensive snaps and out-touched Sony Michel (signed with Miami this offseason) 27 to three.\n\nI expect Akers to be dialed back in as the top RB next season in Sean McVay's consistent 1RB offense, where the team's lead back averages 20-plus touches per game.

through 17 weeks. He also finished the season tied for the league's eighth-highest target share (24%), which was 11 percentage points higher than the next closest Colt, Zach Pascal, at 13%.\n\nHe also made 18 highlight-reel contested catches - fourth most in the NFL.

Long-time general manager Mickey Loomis has had zero issues spending high-end draft capital on WRs in the past, so it's not surprising the Saints traded up to draft Chris Olave at No. 11.\nThe former Buckeye doesn't offer the same skill set as Thomas, but he can separate from defenders at an elite level downfield. Olave wrapped up his 2021 season in the 96th percentile in separation versus single coverage and caught seven touchdowns on throws of 20-plus air yards. \n\nHis downfield skillset should gel well with QB Jameis Winston, who ranked fourth in aDOT last season.\n\nOlave draws parallels to Calvin Ridley with his impressive route running ability. But like Ridley coming out of school, Olave doesn't offer much after the catch.\n\nHis forced broken and missed tackle rate ranked 43rd among 43 qualifying wide receivers in the class.

That's because McKissic caught 37 passes versus Dobbins' three.\n\nGuys like Derrick Henry can overcome the lack of receiving work because they are entrenched bell cows, but that's not the case with Dobbins in Baltimore with Gus Edwards also in the mix. Dobbins only slightly out-touched Edwards 86-74 down the stretch in 2020.\n\nIt would be pure ignorance to assume that Dobbins will take over the backfield considering Edwards has been excellent with every opportunity he has received.\n\nDobbins also ran extremely hot when it came to scoring touchdowns, scoring at least one TD in every game from Week 11 on. His nine total rushing TDs ranked 12th in the league and nearly doubled his expected output (5.5, 30th) - the sixth-highest difference at the position.\n\nDrafters have to understand that to invest in Dobbins as a late third-rounder or fourth-rounder (RB20, 50th overall ADP) he needs to run hot in the TD category coming off the season-ending ACL injury. They also should expect zero-to-little pass-game work with Jackson's tendency to not check down along with the additions of receiving backs, veteran Mike Davis and rookie Tyler Badie.

He tore the ACL in his left knee late in the preseason and underwent ACL reconstruction surgery on September 7. The details surrounding Dobbins' knee injury aren't explicitly clear but there was concern at the time of the injury that Dobbins may have also suffered damage to his LCL in addition to his ACL. If that's the case, we're looking at a multi-ligament reconstruction, which makes the rehab process more complicated and slower than an isolated ACL injury. The good news is that he’ll have approximately one year from the date of his surgery to the start of the regular season. The bad news is that data across the board shows athletes tend to perform better in their second season after the surgery compared to their first. In addition, a 2022 study found that running backs and linebackers in particular are affected more than other positions in terms of returning to pre-injury performance. As of Ravens mini-camp in June, Dobbins wasn't participating in practice, making it unrealistic he's 100% in training camp. There's still an outside chance Dobbins is ready for Week 1, but this ACL/LCL injury adds a lot of volatility to his draft profile. He's unlikely to receive a full workload early in the season, and there's an outside chance we see him start the year on the PUP list.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"21674","position":"RUNNINGBACK","overallPoints":178,"avgPoints":10.5,"positionRank":31,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":814,"rushingTouchdowns":8,"receptions":26,"receivingYards":190,"receivingTouchdowns":1,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":1,"risk":7,"name":"J.K.

After all, Wilson's long track record of efficient fantasy play is undeniable - he has finished among the top-six fantasy QBs five times since 2014.\n\nI like his chances of making it seven in 2022. Because Wilson is still among the league's elite passers when healthy. Before the finger derailed his season, Russ led the NFL in yards per attempt (10.4), passer rating (133.6) and passer rating from a clean pocket (130.9) before Week 5. Wilson also finished the season on a high note, averaging over 24 fantasy points per game in his last three contests.\n\nAll in all, 2021 was a typical season for Wilson: peaks and valleys. He averaged 23 fantasy points per game from Weeks 1-4 and Weeks 16-18. In his six games post-injury, Wilson averaged an abysmal 13 fantasy points per game. Buy the inevitable 2022 dip on the future Hall of Fame quarterback in a new situation.\n\nThat combined with a plethora of weapons in Denver, makes it very plausible he sees similar immediate success that other quarterbacks like Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford have had since changing teams late into their careers.

Breaking tackles and creating after contact in college translates to the pros extremely well, as seen most recently by Denver Broncos running back Javonte Williams.\n\nWilliams led the nation in missed tackle rate (48%) in his final season at North Carolina and would go on to lead the NFL in the same metric at the conclusion of his stellar rookie season. \n\nElusiveness is just one trait Walker has in common with Williams, as both skipped their senior years to enter the draft. Declaring early is a positive sign for a running back in dynasty formats, as they save themselves from another year of wear and tear. \n\nThe lack of work in the passing game is really the only major blemish on Walker's prospect profile because his testing at the NFL scouting combine was also exceptional. He weighed in at 211 pounds and ran a 4.38 40-yard dash (96th percentile).\n\n\"The player I am avoiding is running back Kenneth Walker III. With a rookie draft ADP in the top-3, it's just too steep a price to pay for a running back that is projected to be used heavily on early downs on an offense that easily projects to be bottom-5 in the NFL led by the unsurprising duo of Drew Lock/Geno Smith at quarterback. \n\nEven if Walker can carve out a first-year workload similar to that of Chris Carson circa 2020 - 16.4 touches per game, 56% snaps share when healthy - it's still going to be a massive uphill battle for him to be a fantasy producer in Year 1.\n\nPete Carroll has a stable of backs including Rashaad Penny, Travis Homer and DeeJay Dallas who all figure to work in at some point despite Walker's Round 2 draft capital. \nAgain, even when Carson was the RB1, he was splitting snaps. \n\nPenny was brought back on a one-year deal for $5 million (12tth-highest cap hit), Chris Carson - if healthy - is due $6.1 million (10th-highest cap hit) and Homer/Dallas have routinely worked as pass-catchers out of the backfield. \n\nSeattle also finished dead-last in targets to the RB position last season, creating serious doubt that Walker will be used in that fashion in any capacity as a rookie. Part of that is on Russell Wilson's lack of juice in the screen game, but the offense itself doesn't predicate much RB pass-game usage. Geno Smith posted a meager 12% RB target rate (three per game) in his three starts last season. Drew Lock was at 17%. \n\nThe Seahawks have the chance to be a running back by committee and dumpster fire on offense this season for all the reasons I've laid out, which is why I am adamantly against paying the premium for Walker. If this team falls behind in games, there's no telling which RB will even be on the field. \n\nI feel so much better about going with one of the many rookie WRs selected in Round 1 ahead of Walker based on his landing spot.  \n\nHopefully, opportunities should open in this backfield in Year 2 for Walker with Penny likely leaving in free agency. But does he get replaced with another Day 2 running back? Will Seattle's offense even be efficient in 2023 and beyond? So much uncertainty with this entire situation has me hesitant.

He was unable to participate in OTAs, while his backfield counterpart is full-go as the team installs the new-look Doug Pederson offense. The former undrafted free agent is not guaranteed to be ready for Week 1. Although he did avoid being placed on the PUP list, which is encouraging for his short-term availability. \n\nIt's hard to envision Robinson being anything more than a speculative zero-RB target, with hopes that he can recapture 2020 form if given the volume. However, Pederson's track record of deploying a multitude of backs does make it seem like Robinson will be a 1B to Etienne's 1A, with his clearest path to fantasy relevance coming through goal-line opportunities.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"INJURY_RISK","text":"Robinson’s 2021 season came to an unfortunate end in Week 16 when he tore the Achilles in his left leg. The Jaguars’ RB underwent surgery right around the start of the calendar year, giving him about nine months to be ready for Week 1. While Cam Akers did return to the field in just over five months, this is likely an outlier situation. Despite the incredible recovery from Akers a year ago, fantasy managers expecting this to be the norm after Achilles surgery are likely to be disappointed. The majority of research is conclusive that this is a 9+ month recovery process that can take up to a year. Realistically, Robinson is unlikely to be 100% at the start of the season, and his head coach’s comments in late March support that notion.

He now has the luxury of throwing to a surplus of offensive weapons including arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL in his old college teammate. \n\nLet's not forget that when Carr had everybody available last season, the Raiders quarterback ranked second in the NFL in passing yards and 15th in fantasy points per game. However, his ceiling was limited due to his lack of mobility and weaponry; Carr did not finish better than a top-8 quarterback at any point in 2021. \n\nBut Adams figures to provide Carr with a red-zone weapon like no other that will unlock his fantasy ceiling. He's the exact positive touchdown regression that should launch Carr's fantasy numbers. Carr's 3.7 TD rate in 2021 was below his career average (4.3). And his 23 total passing touchdowns were seven below expectation.\n\nFully anticipate Carr throwing for 30-plus laser scores bare minimum with Adams at his disposal. Every quarterback last season that threw for at least 30 touchdowns finished inside the top-10 in 2021.

No word yet on how close they are and if breakfast is in their summer plans.

Even with 4,800+ passing yards and finishing 2nd among all QBs in 20+ yard pass plays last season, his lack of rushing yards ultimately hurts him from hanging with the elites for fantasy. The Raiders also were quite fortunate in 2021 going 10-7 despite having a win expectation of just 6.9. In the ultra-competitive AFC West, things only might get tougher in 2022.

And Rodgers' only healthy season-long fantasy finish outside the top-8 came in a season where Adams missed four games. \n\nThe dynamic duo's chemistry was never more apparent in or near the red zone, with Rodgers-Adams combining for 64 touchdowns - double-digits on average - since 2016, 23 more than the next closest duo (Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill). Thirty-three percent of Rodgers touchdowns have gone to Adams over that period. \n\nGreen Bay has bolstered their wide receiver room through free agency and the draft, but it's still improbable that they can make up for Adams' production - especially in the red zone.

Well, it seems like the rest of the world is ready to move on after Seattle selected Kenneth Walker III in the 2nd round of the NFL Draft. Penny seems like one of the better depth RBs you can add to your team in fantasy drafts this year. Seattle and Pete Carroll want to establish the run every chance they get and they were effective in the second half of the year in doing so. Penny is still the lead back in our opinion after Seattle re-signed him to a one year $5.75 million deal this off-season.

He ended up leading the league in yards per carry (6.3) and running for 700+ in his final six games. It was the stuff of fantasy legends and the Seahawks decided to bring him back on a one-year deal.

Conner averaged 26.2 fantasy points and 5.5 targets per game in those six games while running a route on 61% of the Cardinals' dropbacks. His RB finishes in half-point scoring during those weeks: RB1, RB16, RB8, RB11, RB2, and RB3.                                                ","source":"FantasyPros"},{"timestamp":"VALUE","text":"When you combine the workload, the touchdown equity, and the lack of competition in Arizona, Conner is ending up as one of the best draft-day values on the board. When Chase Edmonds was injured last year, Conner's role launched into a different stratosphere averaging five targets a game to go with his elite goal-line role. He led the league in red-zone rushing TDs (15) last year despite seeing less than half the carries (43) of Jonathan Taylor (49). All three Ballers have him ranked near RB1 territory but he's going nowhere close to that range.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"18983","position":"RUNNINGBACK","overallPoints":254,"avgPoints":14.9,"positionRank":12,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":913,"rushingTouchdowns":12,"receptions":44,"receivingYards":392,"receivingTouchdowns":2,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":2,"risk":6,"name":"James Conner","blurb":"The headline for Conner’s 2021 season was 18 TDs!

lack of opportunities, either. He finished top-15 in route participation (68%) and had almost zero competition for targets with injuries to Kenny Golladay, Kadarius Toney and Sterling Shepard.\nAlas, Engram failed to command any worthwhile target share with his abysmal 14% target rate per route run. So consider me slightly hesitant to buy into Engram breaking out in 2022 because his new head coach has a history of featuring tight ends. Sure, it works in Engram's favor, but last I checked Dan Arnold is still on the team. And Doug Pederson has also been known to heavily feature two tight ends in his offense, which doesn't always translate to fantasy success.

Jacksonville TEs saw 19 percent of the team's targets and for a five-week stretch in the middle of the season before getting injured, Dan Arnold saw 7.4 targets a game.

He was competing for targets with senior Chris Olave and sophomore standout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who led the nation in PFF receiving grade (91.7). \n\nGoing beyond the box score reveals that Wilson is a versatile route runner who can align anywhere on the field and still win.\n\nHe was selected by the New York Jets 10th overall and joins a somewhat crowded WR room. And nobody can be sure Zach Wilson can support one or multiple fantasy assets. There are definitely question marks.\n\nHowever, Wilson is worth betting on because he's shown the ability at Ohio State to command targets and produce in an offense littered with other elite talents. Doesn't hurt his chance that he was deemed open on 84% of his targets last season.

He was a top-10 running back in PPR averaging 17 fantasy points per game averaging just south of 15 touches per game.\n\nHunt's true upside will always be capped in a backfield as the Robin to Chubb's Batman. But should an injury occur to Chubb or another star running back, Hunt would easily flirt with league-winning upside if he is awarded the requisite volume to do so.\n\nHis 6th-ranked yards after contact per attempt (3.54), 6th-ranked yards per route run (1.81) and 26% target rate suggest he's not slowing down entering age 27-season.

A lot has changed since with Deshaun Watson in town and now Hunt enters the final year of his contract. He'll always play second-fiddle to Nick Chubb in terms of usage. If there is another area of concern, it's the fact that during his last three full years as the Texans' starting QB, Watson targeted the RB position 14.7 percent of the time, dead last in the NFL.

The shoulder should not be an issue at all this season.","source":"Fantasy Footballers"}]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"18883","position":"WIDERECEIVER","overallPoints":202,"avgPoints":11.9,"positionRank":35,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":2,"rushingTouchdowns":0,"receptions":86,"receivingYards":865,"receivingTouchdowns":5,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":0,"risk":4,"name":"JuJu Smith-Schuster","blurb":"Tyreek Hill vacates a 25% target share from a season ago, so it’s easy to tell yourself a story where JuJu is back in the good graces of fantasy managers after a lackluster couple of seasons in Pittsburgh. Of course, Patrick Mahomes is a guy who can support multiple fantasy options, but the WR2 role behind Tyreek has not been profitable for fantasy purposes. With Kelce still dominating targets, there’s probably only room for one of the KC WRs to be a reliable fantasy option. It’s possible that guy is JuJu, but one thing is for sure and that’s Jackson Mahomes and JuJu teaming up for some killer TikTok dances this season.","flexRank":62,"flexGrade":54,"flexGradeBadgeClass":"badge-graded-lightest-green","dynastyBlurb":"Smith-Schuster’s dynasty value over the last three years has been an absolute roller coaster. Yes, he’s catching passes from Pat Mahomes this year but who knows what will happen for JuJu who’s only signed on a one-year deal worth $3.25 million. The financial investment from KC (or lack thereof), tells us they’re willing to move on after this season if things don’t go as planned."}},"16548":{"fantasyProsId":"16548","tier":15,"playerName":"Zane Gonzalez","position":"KICKER","bye":"13","team":"PANTHERS","draftingDetails":{"currentPlayerValue":-999,"currentPlayerValueBadgeClass":"neg-40","vsValueBadgeClass":null,"roundDrafted":0,"available":true,"rookie":false,"playerToTarget":false,"handcuff":false,"tags":"","icons":[],"handcuffs":null,"positionTeammates":[]},"priorRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":12,"stats":{"ALL":{"colspan":7,"name":"ALL","columns":[{"name":"FG_0_20","value":"0"},{"name":"FG_20_30","value":"6"},{"name":"FG_30_40","value":"1"},{"name":"FG_40_50","value":"10"},{"name":"FG_50_PLUS","value":"3"},{"name":"extraPoints","value":"22"},{"name":"FPTS","value":"88.0"}],"stats":{"FG_20_30":{"name":"FG_20_30","value":"6"},"FG_50_PLUS":{"name":"FG_50_PLUS","value":"3"},"FG_0_20":{"name":"FG_0_20","value":"0"},"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"88.0"},"FG_40_50":{"name":"FG_40_50","value":"10"},"FG_30_40":{"name":"FG_30_40","value":"1"},"EXTRAPOINTS":{"name":"extraPoints","value":"22"}}}}},"projectedRawStatsDetails":{"weeksOfData":0,"stats":{}},"positionalStats":{"projectedTotalPoints":null,"projectedAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalPoints":null,"priorAveragePointsPerGame":null,"priorTotalTargets":null,"priorAverageTargetsPerGame":null,"priorStatsByWeekNumber":{"2":{"colspan":1,"name":"2","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"3":{"colspan":1,"name":"3","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"4":{"colspan":1,"name":"4","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"5":{"colspan":1,"name":"5","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"12"}}},"6":{"colspan":1,"name":"6","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"8"}}},"7":{"colspan":1,"name":"7","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"8":{"colspan":1,"name":"8","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"17"}}},"9":{"colspan":1,"name":"9","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"6"}}},"10":{"colspan":1,"name":"10","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"14"}}},"11":{"colspan":1,"name":"11","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}},"12":{"colspan":1,"name":"12","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"4"}}},"14":{"colspan":1,"name":"14","columns":[{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}],"stats":{"FPTS":{"name":"FPTS","value":"3"}}}}},"rankMetadata":{"overallRank":"404","positionRank":"34","bestRank":"293","worstRank":"353","avgRank":"322.55","stdDev":"20.23","adp":"1000","vsAdp":null,"rookieRanking":null},"offensiveLineMetadata":{"rank":null,"passingScore":null,"rushingScore":null,"avgScore":null},"pictureMetadata":{"picLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_200,h_200,c_fill/league/mdokiapjr7z9j0haogbu","smallPicLink":"https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/w_65,h_90,c_fill/league/mdokiapjr7z9j0haogbu","picLocation":"/images/players/ZaneGonzalez.png"},"notesMetadata":{"notes":[]},"ffBallersPlayerProjection":{"playerId":"19079","position":"KICKER","overallPoints":0,"avgPoints":0.0,"positionRank":16,"passingTouchdowns":0,"passingYards":0,"rushingYards":0,"rushingTouchdowns":0,"receptions":0,"receivingYards":0,"receivingTouchdowns":0,"interceptionsThrown":0,"fumblesLost":0,"risk":0,"name":"Zane Gonzalez","blurb":"","flexRank":0,"flexGrade":0,"flexGradeBadgeClass":null,"dynastyBlurb":""}}}}
